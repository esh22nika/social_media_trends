1o4mdcc,NoStupidQuestions,How does kissing work?,"Throwaway account because this is an embarrassing question obviously. I've never kissed anyone and I'm scared to because it seems so unintuitive. I see people say 'you'll get the hang of it quickly when you start doing it' or 'do what feels natural' but sometimes I'm so stupid about picking up on new skills and I need them explicitly explained beyond what would normally be needed. Even sex is easier for me to understand and in some ways less scary.

Like, are you just sliding your lips together or are you using suction? Do you try to make the 'kiss' sound intentionally or does it just happen naturally? When I try kissing my own hand it doesn't make that sound. How much pressure are you using? Should you kiss both their lips at once, or just pick top or bottom? When you use tongue, are you just sticking it into their mouth or are you doing something specific with it?

I'm 18, and while I like being feminine and don't mind being a girl, I've never really felt like one. Like, when I act feminine I feel like a stereotypical gay guy, not a girly girl. Around other girls I feel like a guy, but then around guys I either feel like a guy or a girl. 

I'm bi. I noticed when I like women..I think of myself as a potential boyfriend. When I like men, sometimes I want to be their boyfriend. But.. sometimes I want to be their girlfriend.

What am I? I don't think I'm trans, because I've never felt sad being born a girl. Girlhood feels like a sweater that kind of fits, but kind of doesn't. Then again, I wouldn't want to be a man all the time either. Sigh.

So when I found out I was pregnant a couple women joking mentioned this, and there was a period where my boobs got bigger but I wasn’t showing and I figured okay, it makes sense more guys are flirting with me, hitting on me, etc. But then as my belly grew, the numbers only increased!

I’m 8 months pregnant and nearly every day a man will blatantly hit on me, ask me out, etc. Some of it’s respectful and sweet, some of it’s creepy, but…. Why??? Can it really be that they all have a fetish? That just seems like it can’t possibly explain the numbers. It’s even friends on social media hitting me up! I’ve never experienced anything like this. 

Is there some kind of social/anthropological reason men would be into this? Men who’ve done this- did you earnestly think you could date, was it a fetish thing, etc. No shaming, just trying to understand!

Note- it’s not that I’m confused about why it’s a fetish, that’s been explained and I understand that. But is that alone the reason SO many more people are making a move or hitting on me? I guess I understand how fewer people being more attracted leads to more interest, from like a marketing perspective, but the frequency just seems too crazy for that to be the only thing going on!

>Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2025. They have developed a new form of molecular architecture. In their constructions, metal ions function as cornerstones that are linked by long organic (carbon-based) molecules. Together, the metal ions and molecules are organised to form crystals that contain large cavities. These porous materials are called metal–organic frameworks (MOF). By varying the building blocks used in the MOFs, chemists can design them to capture and store specific substances. MOFs can also drive chemical reactions or conduct electricity.

>“Metal–organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,” says Heiner Linke, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.

>It all started in 1989, when Richard Robson tested utilising the inherent properties of atoms in a new way. He combined positively charged copper ions with a four-armed molecule; this had a chemical group that was attracted to copper ions at the end of each arm.

>When they were combined, they bonded to form a well-ordered, spacious crystal. It was like a diamond filled with innumerable cavities.

>Robson immediately recognised the potential of his molecular construction, but it was unstable and collapsed easily. However, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi provided this building method with a firm foundation; between 1992 and 2003 they made, separately, a series of revolutionary discoveries. Kitagawa showed that gases can flow in and out of the constructions and predicted that MOFs could be made flexible. Yaghi created a very stable MOF and showed that it can be modified using rational design, giving it new and desirable properties.

>Following the laureates’ groundbreaking discoveries, chemists have built tens of thousands of different MOFs.

>Quantum mechanics allows a particle to move straight through a barrier, using a process called tunnelling. As soon as large numbers of particles are involved, quantum mechanical effects usually become insignificant. The laureates’ experiments demonstrated that quantum mechanical properties can be made concrete on a macroscopic scale.

>In 1984 and 1985, **John Clarke**, **Michel H. Devoret** and **John M. Martinis** conducted a series of experiments with an electronic circuit built of superconductors, components that can conduct a current with no electrical resistance. In the circuit, the superconducting components were separated by a thin layer of non-conductive material, a setup known as a Josephson junction. By refining and measuring all the various properties of their circuit, they were able to control and explore the phenomena that arose when they passed a current through it. Together, the charged particles moving through the superconductor comprised a system that behaved as if they were a single particle that filled the entire circuit.

>This macroscopic particle-like system is initially in a state in which current flows without any voltage. The system is trapped in this state, as if behind a barrier that it cannot cross. In the experiment the system shows its quantum character by managing to escape the zero-voltage state through tunnelling. The system’s changed state is detected through the appearance of a voltage.

>The laureates could also demonstrate that the system behaves in the manner predicted by quantum mechanics – it is quantised, meaning that it only absorbs or emits specific amounts of energy.

>“It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,” says Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.

>The transistors in computer microchips are one example of the established quantum technology that surrounds us. This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics has provided opportunities for developing the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.",shiruken,2025-10-07 20:49:37,384,0.97,11,395,text,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,/r/science/comments/1o0hps8/the_nobel_prize_in_physics_2025_awarded_to_john/,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1o0hps8/the_nobel_prize_in_physics_2025_awarded_to_john/,self.science,0,News,PhD | Biomedical Engineering | Optics,0,moderator,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clarke_(physicist)),"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Devoret),"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Martinis)"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/)"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/popular-information/)"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/advanced-information/)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9FUkAis62s)""]",2972,208,science:hot,,,,,,shiruken,2010-08-31 00:34:57,731421.0,341924.0,1073345.0,True,True,True

>Technology advances rapidly and affects us all, with new products and production methods replacing old ones in a never-ending cycle. This is the basis for sustained economic growth, which results in a better standard of living, health and quality of life for people around the globe.

>However, this was not always the case. Quite the opposite – stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history. Despite important discoveries now and again, which sometimes led to improved living conditions and higher incomes, growth always eventually levelled off.

>Joel Mokyr used historical sources as one means to uncover the causes of sustained growth becoming the new normal. He demonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why. The latter was often lacking prior to the industrial revolution, which made it difficult to build upon new discoveries and inventions. He also emphasised the importance of society being open to new ideas and allowing change.

>Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt also studied the mechanisms behind sustained growth. In an article from 1992, they constructed a mathematical model for what is called creative destruction: when a new and better product enters the market, the companies selling the older products lose out. The innovation represents something new and is thus creative. However, it is also destructive, as the company whose technology becomes passé is outcompeted.

>In different ways, the laureates show how creative destruction creates conflicts that must be managed in a constructive manner. Otherwise, innovation will be blocked by established companies and interest groups that risk being put at a disadvantage.

>“The laureates’ work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underly creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,” says John Hassler, Chair of the Committee for the prize in economic sciences.",shiruken,2025-10-13 20:29:06,13,0.88,0,13,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/science/comments/1o5m1il/sveriges_riksbank_prize_in_economic_sciences_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1o5m1il/sveriges_riksbank_prize_in_economic_sciences_in/,self.science,0,News,PhD | Biomedical Engineering | Optics,0,moderator,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Mokyr)"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Aghion)"", ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Howitt_(economist))"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/press-release/)"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/popular-information/)"", ""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/advanced-information/)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajZObplJ8U)""]",2954,296,science:hot,,,,,,shiruken,2010-08-31 00:34:57,731421.0,341924.0,1073345.0,True,True,True

1o3xmqe,Futurology,Are we headed towards a techno-feudalist world order?,"Isn't it a funny coincidence how there are right wing populist parties on the rise in almost every western democracy? These parties broadly share the same values: nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-lgbtq, often anti-democratic. They make claims about wanting to improve conditions of working class citizens, but if you look closer into their policies, they are all about increasing the wealth gap, cutting welfare systems and removing tax burdens of the top 1%. Secretly, they're all working towards an authoritarian regime.

They all seem to follow the same playbook.

If you take an even closer look you can easily see that there is a conspiracy going on right in front of our all eyes. This is not a ""conspiracy theory"" - it's an actual conspiracy. And it's not happening in the shadows, it's happening in broad daylight for everyone to see: these parties are all well connected to each other through a wide international network. Vox's Madrid Forum. CPAC in Hungary. Steve Bannon's involvement with Marine Le Pen, the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025) meeting with the German ruling party and so on and so forth.

Why is this a thing? What could all these ultra nationalist parties have in common? After all, if they're all more or less fascist and anti-immigrants - shouldn't they resent each other? It's simple really: They're not really fascists. They don't really hate foreigners. They don't really think that gay people should burn in hell. Well, some of them might. But most of them are opportunists. It turns out that this rhetoric, inciting hate against minorities is a very effective strategy to gain voters. And it's a great tool to establish power structures, too. History has given us several playbooks for this, one of the more recent ones being the Nazi regime - which very clearly the current Trump administration is taking some inspiration from, too.

These parties might all be separated by country borders, but the key thing to understand is that they represent the ambitions of groups of national elites that are globally connected through various networks. MAGA, Le Pen, AfD, Vox and all the others - they are run by an elite, a large globally interconnected group of people who want to expand their influence, wealth and power. It's less like the Illuminati but more like a large interconnected network of rich and influential people who share the same ambitions: become more powerful at any cost. It's hard to say how closely or loosely they are collaborating exactly vs. how much of these are emergent patterns. But if we look at events like CPAC: it is clear that they are conspiring to some degree.

What's their gameplan? Help each other to come into power, then dismantle the democracy of their respective countries and establish an authoritarian regime. Squeeze out the middle and working class as much as possible and funnel that money into the pockets of the elites. The fascist playbook, but at a global scale.

Their goal is to create a transnational two class society. You might have heard the term ""techno feudalism"" before - that's essentially what is the end goal here. A two class society where there is a wealthy transnational elite ruling over isolated and impoverished nation states. The middle class will cease to exist for the most part, and what will remain is a large working population and a small but extremely wealthy elite that is globally connected.

And from a game theory perspective, this makes perfect sense. If you are super rich and your goal is to maximize your wealth and influence, then this is the best play. Campaigns like that of Cambridge Analytica already prove that it is totally possible to sway voter outcomes and influence mainstream opinion. Through a combined effort and transnational networks, this new elite class is uniquely positioned to shape voter outcomes and establish autocracies around the world - they own pretty much all social media networks that we use today.

So far, it seems their plan is working out really well. We see it unfold live in the US right now. And even though Trumps poll ratings are dwindling, the thing is: even in a best case scenario where the current attempt to turn the US into an authoritarian regime fails. Even if it fails this time around. Even if there is another round of elections and the Democrats win and our current world order continues as we know it for a few more years. The powers behind all this remain, and they will keep working towards their goal.

Now you might be asking: how did it come to all of this? And the answer is simple: capitalism creates an environment where the most ruthless and ambitious self serving people reach to the top. Not all of these people are outwardly ""evil"". But if you want to make it in capitalism, you need to be morally flexible enough to put your own goals above the goals of others. This selects for highly ambitious people who are willing to do what it takes to advance their goals. And if that means insurrecting a techno feudalist world order, then so be it. It's all basic game theory.",Plenty-Asparagus-580,2025-10-11 20:23:22,1910,0.94,233,2143,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Futurology/comments/1o3xmqe/are_we_headed_towards_a_technofeudalist_world/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1o3xmqe/are_we_headed_towards_a_technofeudalist_world/,self.Futurology,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],5053,53,Futurology:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(A) A human band learns to play acoustic instruments, and writes and performs their own songs to a live audience.

(B) A human band records an electric-guitar-driven record of mostly cover songs on 1960s recording tape, has it mixed with 1960s technology, and has it distributed and sold on vinyl.

(C) A human band records their own song on digital equipment, incorporating MIDI-written keyboard parts.  The production involves advanced digital tools to properly equalize each instrument based on an aggregate of input learning, and the mastering involves A.I. tools.

(D) A human becomes interested in songwriting, and from an early age figures out how to prompt and guide A.I. to create any song from their human mind.  The human writes many of the lyrics, chord progressions, and other musical parts, and communicates to A.I. with precise musical vocabulary.  A.I. fills in creative gaps starting from the human’s prompting, but when the human has creative differences, the human knows exactly how to prompt A.I. to make the necessary changes to fit the human’s vision.  The human builds a following on YouTube, from an audience who enjoys and resonates with the songs.

(E) A human becomes interested in poetry, but has little interest in pursuing music.  The human uploads their heartfelt original poetry to an A.I. program, and has the A.I. program create an instrumental backing that, while not super creative, is consistent with the basic rules of a chosen musical genre.  The human builds a following on YouTube, from an audience who appreciates the lyrics and thinks the songs are overall worth their time listening to.

(F) A human becomes interested in music, but has little interest in expressing lyrics.  The human uploads their personally composed music to an A.I. program, and has the A.I. program generate some lyrics that, while not super creative, are consistent with conventional lyrics of a chosen genre.  The human builds a following on YouTube, from an audience who appreciates the music and thinks the songs are overall worth their time listening to.

(G) A human prompts A.I. to create songs according to the rules of a chosen genre.  With little to no editing, the best of the generated songs are saved.  The human builds a following on YouTube, from an audience who enjoys the human’s selection of saved works.

(C) >! 2 – Local human imagination is still the driving force behind all the artistic aspects, with A.I. being brought into the production to complete tasks that tend to be more standard and routine than creative. !<

(D) >! 3 to 4 – Local human imagination is still the driving force behind most of the artistic aspects.  The human acts the role of a writer and producer, while A.I. acts the role of well-directed musicians. !<

(E) >! 5 to 7 – This represents a significant collaboration with A.I.  Original human ideas do come to surface that otherwise would have been taken to the human’s grave, but A.I. provides other creative aspects of the song for the song to exist. !<

1o4xov9,Futurology,A 3 Step Plan for Utopia for all 8 billion in 10 to 20 years,"**Freedom And Luxury For All Eight Billion in Three Steps**

**Q1:** What is a 100/100 Solution for Humanity?  
  
A single, easy-to-discuss solution that:  


i) Solves & Removes not just 1 or 2, but every single one of humanity’s problems in one shot, for all 8 billion humans, within just 10-20 yrs from today, permanently. (7000+ years of wars, poverty, hunger, crime, environment & animal abuse, rat-races, etc, entire lives lived through struggle, loneliness, unfulfilled dreams and missed life experiences, in a loveless society).  
  
ii) Replaces it with a single united nation, where all 8 billion have luxury and the freedom to do anything with all their time (Creativity, Religion & Spirituality, Love, Family, Science, Research, Business, Work, Travel, Fitness, Fun, Entertainment, Relaxation, etc), while the world runs smoothly by itself.  
  
iii) To work, it doesn’t need any more of the masses’ time, donations, volunteering, etc.  


**Q2:** What is **THE QUESTION**?  
  
If tomorrow you hear that all political parties across countries have joined hands, holding an election for all 8 billion of us, where we get to vote to unite the world and start a new but true “Utopia Society System”, where your life and everybody else’s would instantly 1000X, would you vote yes?  
  
  
**Q3:** What is the **3 STEP PLAN**?  
  
Step 1: This simple 3-Step Plan + Question spreads in a domino movement, slowly over the next few years across the world to all humans through simple 5 minute conversations, becoming for the first time something that all of us can agree upon, that regardless of whether rich or poor, law-abiding or criminal, religious or atheist, if such a Utopian System were truly developed 10-20 years later, we’d vote Yes for it.

Step 2: Inspired by the above worldwide movement and the greatest Challenge in humanity’s history, the top 1% of humanity’s most capable, our best & brightest across every field like AI, science, music, art, religion, politics, spirituality, sports, medicine, etc will self-organize (helped by Artificial General Intelligence) and over 10-20 years, build the greatest Artificial Super Intelligence they can, which then does the uncountable number of trials & steps required to build a Utopian Society System (and its transition) built on principles of love and the infinite expansion of human spirit for all 8 billion.

Step 3: Everyone individually verifies the finished System, then a Global Election is held, all 8 billion vote Yes, and after the transition steps, the Utopia Era begins!

1o0i3eg,Futurology,The developed world's future economic crisis of shrinking birth rates has arrived early in France and is causing its government to collapse. Is a Debt Jubilee the answer?,"The French government is in turmoil. There have been 5 different Prime Ministers since 2024, the most recent one resigning a few weeks into the job. All have left for the same reason. The French state is becoming ever more indebted paying for its citizens' welfare entitlements, but politicians cannot bring themselves to cut them or tax more. Now the country is close to a debt crisis, with spiralling interest payments.

The situation in France is acute, but other developed nations like the US, Japan, and Britain are also close to the same crisis, and for the same reasons. It's a structural demographic shift. The ageing of populations across the developed world is no longer a distant challenge. It is now a live crisis, and its financial, political, and social effects are beginning to cascade. Existing solutions to this problem - like mass immigration - have run their course.

A Debt Jubilee is the cancellation of all debts of a certain class, and they've been carried out many times in history, going back to ancient times. Is it an idea that is due for a revival?

you could even go back to when revenge of the sith leaked before release or when the first 10 minutes of rise of skywalker got out and fans tore it to shreds. expendables 3 leaked before theaters and they blamed that for killing the box office. and the matrix resurrections trailer leaking early just made everyone clown on it before it even had a chance

1o5asw6,movies,The most alien creatures in movies?,"So I want to talk a bit about creature design in movies, TV shows and even games. I get that it is and was often a budget and technical thing, but I am kinda sad that movies and TV shows are hardly ever very creative, when it comes to creature design.

Like most are actually very humanoid, have two arms, two legs, eyes, ears etc. They often even move in very ""normal"" ways, some are different but still like creatures that we know, spiders, horses, dogs. You could do so much already if you just changed up how creatures move, have It very smooth or very abrupt.. 

I read once that that also has psychological reasons, that if a thing that looks relatable to us humans is easier to be afraid of, or even easier, if we are already afraid of spiders, we come already pre-afraid of spider like aliens, which sounds kinda cheap to me. But I'd say if you managed to make something so alien we don't understand it and then terrify/or fascinate (doesn't need to be horror) us with its actions, it would be even better. 

There are very few exceptions like the creature from nope! comes to mind first that was at least so alien, that it made me come up with this topic in the first place, even though it also has similarities with some deep sea creatures and it's behaviors. Or the things from arrival that still basically are octopus-adjacent.. 

**So what are the most alien designs out there? Why aren't there more of them, at least now in the age of cgi? Does the human mind have trouble coming up with something truly original?**

Also for games it's weird, since you have to create the creature from the start anyway, so why not go wild? But I guess it's easier to animate and rig if it's animal like.

1o52k28,movies,Interstellar,"Hear me out…

I have never been much of a film person but every now and then I get the urge to relax and watch one. So this evening I decided it’s time to watch Interstellar.

I’ve been in love with the soundtrack for years and have even started learning it on the piano, so I thought it’s best to watch it.

It’s also worth mentioning that I’m not a sci-fi person either, however I can bridge that gap if something really catches my eye.

What a masterpiece! Absolutely mind blowing all round!!!.

I’m interested in hearing some suggestions for other films that are of an equal level of brilliance (not necessarily sci-fi), as I said I’m not much of a movie guy but suggestions to some real bangers would not go unheard.

Thanks in advance! Hope you all enjoyed it 1st time as much as I did ☺️💯",MrRicardo93,2025-10-13 03:49:51,55,0.62,187,242,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/movies/comments/1o52k28/interstellar/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o52k28/interstellar/,self.movies,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],795,12,movies:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o50ek3,television,Twisted Metal is ridiculously entertaining,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from the Twisted Metal show given what an odd piece of source material it's being adapted from. A fairly plotless vehicle warfare game franchise doesn't really seem like something you could mine a compelling narrative out of. But after binging both seasons of the show, that's exactly what Twisted Metal does.

Honestly this show is the very definition of ""they understood the assignment"". The TM games were always pretty ridiculous and the setup is really only there to have an excuse for the colourful characters and vehicles. So the show smartly doesn't really try to avoid the tone and vibe of the games, and instead fully leans into them. It's silly, over the top and ridiculous, and it's honestly better for it. The dark comedy/action hybrid fits the games perfectly. The first season has more of an episodic structure as we get to know the characters and the world, and the second season, which is better in every way, has more of a serialized arc. The second season is where the tournament aspect of Twisted Metal really comes into play too.

The show does justice when it comes to adapting the gameplay aspects - there are some truly spectacular vehicle combat sequences, especially in season 2, and there's a lot of fun, clever usage of the various weapons and powerups you'd see in the game.

What really elevates the show though are the characters. They're really well-acted and developed, and as silly and irreverent as the story is, the writing treats the characters seriously and does a great job of getting you really invested in them. Anthony Mackie and Stephanie Beatriz are both excellent as the leads, and they actually have some really great chemistry together. The absolute highlight of the show though is Sweet Tooth - he steals every scene he's in, and it's an excellent ""fusion"" performance between Samoa Joe and Will Arnett. 

The music is incredible too, with some fantastic needle drops of popular 90s/00s tunes as well as the actual soundtrack of the show itself.

Overall, it's a show made by people that clearly love the source material. It's not high-art and it's often stupid and full of plot holes. But that doesn't stop it from being incredibly fun and entertaining, and most importantly, being a really damn good adaptation.",keepfighting90,2025-10-13 02:21:40,168,0.81,47,215,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/television/comments/1o50ek3/twisted_metal_is_ridiculously_entertaining/,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1o50ek3/twisted_metal_is_ridiculously_entertaining/,self.television,0,,,0,none,[],2296,42,television:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o3rs14,television,"The Supreme Court of Ukraine outlawed broadcasting of the HBO Chernobyl miniseries by claim of its ""character"" Lyudmila Ignatenko","Five years ago in April 2020 Lyudmila Ignatenko came to the court and claimed that HBO should stop lying (a.k.a. _""using artistic license""_) about her and her husband. She stated that the company never reached her to get the permission to use their names. 

Legally speaking, on May 29, 2024, the Supreme Court of Ukraine [ruled on this case](https://sud.ua/ru/news/publication/305782-verkhovnyy-sud-rassmotrel-delo-protiv-kanala-hbo-kotoryy-v-seriale-chernobyl-bez-razresheniya-ispolzoval-imena-i-istoriyu-likvidatora-avarii-na-chaes-vasiliya-ignatenko)  and stated that the use of an individual's name without their permission in a work that covers not only objective events but also includes the authors' conjectures is unlawful and may constitute a violation of that individual's personal non-property right to use their name. In such a case, the individual has the right to demand that the violation of their rights be stopped and compensation for moral damages be awarded. The basis for protecting such a violated right is the very fact of using the individual's name, regardless of the nature of the information disseminated about the individual.

1o3tzvi,television,Midnight Mass is still one of the most incredible shows I’ve ever seen.,"I must have watched this 5 times now and each time it hits me a little deeper. There are some shows that just reach something deep within you and this is one of them. I truly think it’s a masterpiece. I understand a lot of people didn’t enjoy the longer dialogue scenes but honestly I felt so connected to these characters during those moments and it’s so deeply human. It’s heartbreaking and terrifying and a really breathtakingly beautiful piece.

1o3t7d7,television,The state of streaming service prices is a joke right now,"For years I always seen the running gag where people said (paraphrasing) ""streaming services costs as much as cable now"" but I really didn't pay it any mind. Up until a few months ago I was paying for Paramount, Peacock, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+/Hulu & received HBO through AT&T. So roughly about $75/$85 a month. 

Here's where my realization began ; 

When I went to get a new iPhone AT&T informed me they were going to start charging me 20.99 for HBO by way of my phone bill so I *supposedly* wouldn't notice it, red flag #1. 

I read an email from Peacock saying that *they* of all services were raising their prices starting at 10.99, red flag #2. Besides Hulu I think Peacock has the best UI but 10.99???? *with* commercials??? That app is a not worth it. I went to cancel & they offered me 6 months for 2.99 which is basically what I got last year around black friday. I'll settle for that (for now) and look for another black friday deal with a different email in 2 months time. 

Paramount although paired with Showtime is the most buggy & unstable of them all increased from 10.99 to 11.99, INSANITY. Canceled that immediately. Their catalogue save a few new recent series isn't worth the price. I only kept it for as long as I did because episodes play all night without stopping while I slept. 

I've had a hate-hate relationship for a very long time. They introduced locking movies behind paywalls which is insanity!!! Their catalogue is subpar and their original programming doesn't last that long with all those cancellations. I paused my membership but will ultimately cancel. Haven't been a fan for years.

Disney+ started out nostalgia based and I outgrew that within the first year of its release. If they they didn't bundle their subscription with Hulu then I wouldve cancelled it a very long time ago. They gave me a black friday deal last year for 12 months at 2.99 I think so i'm not *too* mad at them. Honestly I enjoyed Shogun, Alien Earth, Andor & some other shows so Disney can get some grace from me. 

Prime Video is whatever. If it wasn't for Amazon I wouldn't even use it. Rings of Power is every 2 years & Wheel of Time has been cancelled so that app is so so for me. Plus their UI is garbage & timely to navigate. I cancelled & will restart some time next year.

I haven't had cable in about 5 years & I thought having all these streaming apps was a good alternative but over the years they've shown they're just as money hungry. 

I'm not even going to get started on that ESPN/WWE $30 a month malarkey they introduced not too long ago.",AD_EI8HT,2025-10-11 16:57:39,1045,0.87,444,1489,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/television/comments/1o3t7d7/the_state_of_streaming_service_prices_is_a_joke/,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1o3t7d7/the_state_of_streaming_service_prices_is_a_joke/,self.television,0,,,0,none,[],2575,57,television:top,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is really nothing else like this novel in my experience. I don’t know of any other work that is at once so breezy, exquisitely written, and totally grotesque. Beyond that, he has a vision as legitimate as and that of any other author. And by vision, I mean the creation of a world and aesthetic that is complete and unique. It is the world of drugs, body horror, the bohemian and the marginalized as we would put it today. It feels extremely modern. It is electrifying. It is witty and scary and disgusting, and it is ingenious.

1o4yilj,books,My expectations didn’t match the reality of “Greenlight” by Matthew McConaughey,"The book is a kind of actor's memoirs. He tells the story of his childhood, 20s, and 30s years of life, sharing some stories about his career and personal life. About his “greenlights” and “redlights”.

In general, it was not bad. I really enjoyed the part about McConaughey's early years. All the stories about his father were simultaneously funny, controversial, and instructive.

But the other part—about his life as an adult, I didn't find quite impressive. There was too much preaching, and some facts were even a little unbelievable, as for me.

And I also didn't read it, but listened, because I knew that Matthew had narrated it by himself, so I wanted to hear the book from the author's mouth. However, I was truly disappointed—too much acting for my taste.

It would be fascinating to hear your thoughts about this book. Did you find it interesting? What part did you like the most? Does anybody share my opinion?

1o490m8,books,The moment in a book when you realized the main character might actually be the villain.,"Some books start with you rooting for the main character, but somewhere along the way you start to feel uneasy. You realize their thoughts or actions are not heroic at all, they might actually be the villain.

It happened to me with Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. At first, it feels like a mystery about a missing wife, but the more you read, the more you see how twisted both sides really are.   
  
Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov did the same in a much darker way. The writing pulls you in, but then you realize you have been reading from the mind of a monster.   
  
American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis is another one where the slow build of Patrick Bateman’s thoughts turns horrifying once you see who he truly is.

You by Caroline Kepnes make you realize how easy it is to mistake obsession for love when told from the wrong perspective.

What book made you stop and think, wait, am I supposed to be on this person’s side?

1o4pznx,books,Finished Hero of Ages: here’s my thoughts on it,"Reposting this because Reddit it’s kinda weird lol

Here I am again.

Head spinning, heart full. I had to write this before it fades away, because The Hero of Ages is, without a doubt, the most perfect thing I’ve ever read in my 27 years of life. I don’t even know how to explain it without feeling like words are too small for what I feel. It’s simply… perfect.

When I think of order, logic, science, and physics, the invisible structure that keeps the universe from falling apart, this book becomes the purest reflection of that. It’s those concepts, translated into the language of fantasy. If logic and science had a soul, it would be this book. This universe Brandon Sanderson created.

From the very beginning of the Mistborn trilogy, I always had this feeling that if it weren’t a fantasy story, it could still work perfectly in the real world. There was something behind it, something that felt true. And now I understand why. Sanderson didn’t just invent a world, he observed our own from a different angle. Ruin and Preservation aren’t just powers in a magic system; they’re a lesson about existence itself. They are the most beautiful expression of balance, of how destruction and creation need each other, how chaos and order are two sides of the same coin.

For most of the trilogy, I was convinced the Hero of Ages would be Vin. I was so sure. I was ready for that. And when I realized it wasn’t her, I felt two full seconds of absolute shock, then silence, then peace. It made sense. All of it. It was the world finding its equilibrium again. It was perfect logic. That moment… it was the kind of understanding that almost hurts because it’s so right.

The character arcs are pure art. Vin, Elend, Sazed… each of them shaped by purpose. Elend’s death broke me, but it was also beautiful. It had to happen. It meant something. And Vin, God she was everything.

This book feels otherworldly. It doesn’t just end a story, it ends an era of thought. It fuses physics, religion, morality, and art in such perfect structure that it feels divine. As a person, being able to write something so complex and raw as this is beyond amazing.

Sazed’s existential struggles, for instance, were fascinating to me. When everything connected in the third book, and those inner conflicts finally made sense, I felt something like awe. Like someone had just explained the equation of the universe. Sazed’s search through religions, his study of belief and doubt, the way he finds truth through emptiness, its genius. It’s as if Sanderson took Newton’s laws and turned them into a spiritual symphony.

And yes, there are still questions. About why Vin. About the origin of everything. About what lies beyond. But those questions are part of the brilliance. They remind you that knowledge is never complete. That even divinity has mysteries. The way Sanderson mirrors the concept of God in this story is absolutely staggering. Brutal, in the most awe-inspiring sense of the word.

The ending was exquisite. Painful, necessary, inevitable. Every sacrifice, every decision, every revelation sits exactly where it should. I wouldn’t change a single thing. The Hero of Ages doesn’t just conclude a trilogy, it opens a door. Now I understand why he recommends this as a starter for the Cosmere. The ending of Hero of Ages is one of the most perfect endings I’ve ever read in my life.

Vin. Elend. Sazed. Ruin. Preservation. Every piece of it. Perfect. This story will never die.",HiddenTulips,2025-10-12 19:37:36,14,0.64,5,19,text,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,/r/books/comments/1o4pznx/finished_hero_of_ages_heres_my_thoughts_on_it/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o4pznx/finished_hero_of_ages_heres_my_thoughts_on_it/,self.books,0,,,0,none,[],3468,47,books:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o5l9lp,books,5 Books to read for pleasure—my top as a real book lover,"At various times, I read between 50 and 60, and sometimes 10, books a year. Last year, I stopped at 27 books, and now I want to share my top 5 books that impressed me the most this year. Let’s go.

**5. “The Five Love Languages ​​for a Child” by Gary Chapman**. This book explores the various types of love and their impact on our lives. It’s not a manual, but it’s filled with ideas that, if applied, can bring more joy to your children’s lives. It’s a book that made me reflect on my relationships and how to make my loved ones feel truly cherished

As with any book in this genre, I wouldn’t advise treating it as an instruction manual or the Bible. However, if implemented and followed, some ideas can bring more pleasant moments to your children’s lives.

**4. “The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year” by Sue Townsend** is one of my favourite books this year and my entire life. Despite its lack of a dynamic plot or deep meaning, it's a book that I find incredibly relaxing and enjoyable. The book's atmosphere allows me to relax and go with the flow, which is a rare and precious experience in today’s fast-paced world

Yes, in it, a woman decides to lie down, and somewhere ⅞ of the entire plot, she lies in bed. Someone comes to her, and somehow, the life of her husband and children develops, and she lies. Then, lying down takes a threatening turn, and I really feel sorry for the woman. I love this book because it reminds me that sometimes you can lie down and see what can happen if you lie down and stay in that state.

**3. “How to be your therapist” by Owen O’Kane**. Last year, I finished four years of therapy, and this book has greatly inspired me to do it myself. I liked some exercises; I thought about how the past can help me move into the future. I recommend it to anyone interested in self-knowledge

**2. “Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow” by Gabrielle Zevin**. This book is a gem, a unique and beautiful story that I wish I could experience for the first time again. It’s a book I truly love and has left a lasting impression on me

**1. “Choice” by Edith Eger** is perhaps the best book I have ever read. It’s a powerful memoir about the author’s experiences in a concentration camp and her subsequent trials. It’s a story of indomitability, strength of spirit, and the truth we confront every day. This inspiring book is a must-read, even for those who don’t typically read non-fiction

I was not very impressed by **“Divorce” by Moa Herngren**, but it is a personal book for those who have survived and are ready to look openly at the processes that occur in couples, so it is not for a wide audience, like me.

1o3z0yl,books,German Sie and du in translations,I'm reading The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann in a Dutch translation and one of the smaller points that comes op sometimes is using the correct pronoun when addressing someone.

1o4v1gv,books,The Origin by Dan Brown.,"I got this book in 2022, one month after the release of ChatGPT (people were talking about it, but it wasn’t that big of a deal as it is now). Sadly, I didn’t read it at that time. I wish I had, though. The book was released in 2017, and I feel that if I had read it then, I would have liked it a lot, I guess. Because other than what happens on the last page, nothing really surprised me.

As I was reading it initially, I got frustrated about this discovery that Edmund found but was not revealing what it was. He kept building up a lot of suspense at every step, but after some time, I gave up and let him reveal it whenever he wanted to. But the moment I got to know about that supercomputer, I got an understanding of what it might be. So the discovery wasn’t that satisfactory for me, and to be honest, I don’t think it can shake religions even if it happens now because it’s just modelling. The result is driven by modelling.

Till this point, I felt that the book was okay — not the best one, but interesting. As I was nearing the end, I completely forgot about the murders that were committed by the Regent, and when it was confessed at the end, that was really shocking and unexpected, to be honest — and how Winston plotted all this. I am not sure how many evil plans he might have plotted, or subplots he created to achieve this, just because Edmund asked it to have a maximum audience. It’s crazy, and I love it. And the way Winston achieved it is obviously cruel, but he didn’t care at all.

Overall, it’s a very interesting read. I know readers here say that most of Dan Brown’s books follow a similar plot, but this is my first one, and I plan to read The Da Vinci Code too.

Let me know your thoughts...

1o3blmj,books,"The bestest, most excellent, most fabulous brain candy read: Marion Keyes","Marion Keyes appeared in my parents' house when I was, I think, in my mid-twenties. I think perhaps a friend of my mom passed some of her books on to her, but I don't remember my mom reading them, because I don't remember her talking about it. It's not  literature, you know.   

I read her though. I read the fuck out of her and I had a blast. That one about the book agent in London, who used to be a police officer in America, and the aspiring young writers from Ireland? Oh my god- the sky-blue leather jacket that the wife of the agent's lover, who was also her boss, was wearing? The pharmacist whom one of the aspiring writers had a crush on, telling her ""we're a bit long in the tooth for this game""- she looked like Liza Minelli. I can't remember the name of the book but it was amazing. And the other one, where the husband of the newly-married heroine died, and she was heart-broken? And then she was courted by a guy who looked like Anthony Keidis from Red Hot Chili Peppers? She had the best job in the world, remember, she was a make-up rep based in New York. I hadn't experienced grief and bereavement then, but it has visited me since, hard, and somehow that book of Marion Keyes resurfaces back in my brain when I try to cope. The butterflies on the cover.   

The Irish Catholic Mammy or ICM. That was in another one.  I had never come across an ICM before, but now I have my own Canadian version of the ICM, and wow, does she give those stereotypical Jewish moms of Philip Roth's stories a run for their money!

Marion Keyes- she's not ""literature"", but she's incredible. I've of course read other ""brain candy"" books, but none that left a mark on me like her books did. It's so silly and arbitrary, this stupid snobbish divide. I get that Keyes isn't Dostoyevsky or Austen or Houellebeq (barf), thank god for that. What is your most fabulous brain candy?

1o43553,books,"Mated, Manipulated, and Matriarchal: Reviewing Mated to the Alien Baller by Talia Rhea","Mated to the Alien Baller by Talia Rhea Book |Review & Discussion:

**Summary:**
Sandy’s grandma has passed away but not before making sure Sandy takes life by the horns. As a final goodbye she signs her up for True Match, a state of the art Mate matching agency, guaranteed to match you with your soulmate. Well turns out Sandy’s soulmate is a TrikBaller from Levtiram, a far off planet with a matriarchal system. Unfortunately his mother is quite literally the Telfay equivalent to the liquid at the bottom of a dumpster. Just absolutely vile. Is she surrounded by enemies? How will she get out of this? Or is he a victim too? Can she trust her “soul mate”?

***Review-***
This is my 2nd read though. By far my favorite Talia Rhea book. Teared up both times. Please read and come back to discuss. Rotfl. 

One thing about Talia, we are going to explore the emotional side of life. And here we are. 

The first time I read it I was shocked because I went in thinking it’d be the typical rich new husband storyline or “bad boy who changes his ways for a woman”. Oop. Yet again, not at all what the plot of this is. 

We explore the depth of what led to the party boy lifestyle, while also helping Sandy find who she is as a person outside of her grandmas lifestyle chooses. 


#**""Spoilers, Spoilers"" - River Song**

*The following is an open discussion about the book. Details will be discussed here and in the comments. If that's not for you, this is where we part.

 >!Hey, if you are reading this I don't want to hear ""but spoilers"", you had ample warning. lol!<


Okay, let’s get into it.

**Sandy:** Her stubbornness really worked here. I think any other version of a FMC this situation would have escalated quickly. If she was more demure, Elffa would have ran her over. Rane definitely wouldn’t have been able to protect her. Physically? yes. Mentally? No. 

If she came in hot and ready to fight that would have resulted in Elffa going full horror movie. 

So her slow and steady pace worked best. She was able to observe, figure out the best palm and the execute it perfectly. She was even aware that Elffa would retaliate eventually, so it didn’t come as a shock to her and she was able to place enough doubt in the minds of others, plus build Rane up enough that the two sides would collide. 

I like how she said it was her obsession with drama shows, in reality she is just really smart and observant. She is able to work through scenarios quickly, and determine the best route. 

**Rane:** The way his entire community failed him at every opportunity. Yes, his mother is a master manipulator but also no one seemed safe enough for him to confide in. 

Why couldn’t they see how depressed he was? And suicidal? We see him contemplate his death for several chapters. Just allowing himself to be beaten, by Green and Blue and by anyone else who chose to inflict pain. We see home drowning himself in anything he can get his hands on. 

Which, he did say it’s better for him to make the choice and control the dosage but also we see him in the first scene choosing to down an alcohol that could be lethal. 

And that’s just a slice of what’s he has been going through. 

It makes me think of all the real world “party animals” we dismiss and what they are actually going through. 

We know most drug/alcohol abusers start off by using it to cope and then it becomes an addiction. Yet we always belittle/demean and demonize them. Rarely taking the time to figure out what led to the addiction, the homelessness… well until they die. Then it’s “Why didn’t they ever tell anyone?” “This poor person, they just needed some help!”  

But then the cycle repeats with someone else. Or really it’s happening simultaneously. 

But I digress. Per usual. 

**Monster in law-** I don’t want to spend anytime on her. lol. But how did she get her hands on Green/Blues brother? 

**Levtiram:** I can see how the trial to adulthood could be a good thing but they have no goal system in place? 

You’d think they’d then make the person attend different courses or something. (Unless it’s a medical related reason for being denied adulthood.)

And Yes, his mother had friends and bribed people but still no one put two and two together. 

His friends need their butts whooped. How do you let your buddy fall so hard. No one thought to step in? No one thought to investigate a little bit? 

**Protector Embassy:** I’m glad they updated their rules after this but really why didn’t anyone think about making sure the humans had a way to contact the embassy. 

Especially after the many attempts to capture humans. 

They should have been prompted to buy a combot on Holotulle, also they need a better on-boarding database. Each planet should have an introduction guide or something. You’d think it would already exist, that way Ambassadors know how to move around the planet and their society, so why not have that open for Mates that are matched cross culturally?

1o35nku,books,"Reading Stephenie Meyer's Midnight Sun ( Twilight #5), and although I really liked the series, I can barely finish this one.","I read Stephanie Meyers' Twilight series a long time ago. Maybe 15 years ago? But I remember enjoying them. Well, I got on a quest for this fall and winter to read the books I already own, instead of buying any more news ones (except The Will of the Many's #2 out this fall, that I will be buying)  So far I have done pretty well, liking or loving every old forgotten book I own.  Until, this one.  I don't even know exactly what it is, but it bores me to death! It's Edward droning on about how fragrantly tasty Bella smells, how he hungers for her blood, how he worries for her safety. It is mostly inner dialog of Edwards thoughts, of course nothing new happens. For a time he asks questions like ""what is your favorite color? or favorite music"" It's so LOOONGGG. It has more pages than Twilight. I think rereading Twilight would have been more enjoyable. 

Sometimes I think I should stop with a series. That it might start off as fun, and end in tedious, repetition of what was once an enjoyable story.  But the urge to finish a series is huge.. But I might have to stop this one.

1o2w7el,books,My thoughts on A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin,"I have similar feelings to this book as I do to warm sunlight or a fresh autumn breath. This book is comfortable to me. Le Guin does world building in a way that is simple and interesting and powerful. I honestly can not be very unbiased when talking about Ursula K. Le Guin. Even before I read her books or poems, I developed a proximity admiration for her from the ways that my older brothers would speak about her works. I came into this book knowing I was going to like it.

I originally started this book 1-2 years ago. I was in college and constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, so distractions like this book got cast aside for what felt like more pressing matters. Yet, in that time a certain quote from the book rooted itself in my memory, and it is probably one of my favorite quotes . It highlighted the feelings of college for me very well.  It says “You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do…” This quote made me feel like it was okay and normal that things were already out of my control. This feeling and my general admiration made it inevitable that I would start this book again.

This book has wonderfully realized settings and imaginative story beats. The way that Le Guin describes these islands and their cultures, their diversity in thought even within their own cultures. Her worlds feel real even when fantastical. Ever since I started reading I’ve always had an aversion to the overly-detailed descriptions of settings, but the way that Le Guin does it often doesn’t feel like just placing down a setting. There are times the setting tells just as much plot as the main meat of the story. Though there were occasional times where I felt that it dragged on for a bit, these were short enough and the parts I wanted to get to motivated me to get through it.

My personal interpretation of the shadow, though I might not be breaking any new ground with this, is that the shadow was a manifestation of Ged’s fear, anxiety, and regret. As he runs away from it, it gains power. As he faces his fear it loses power. The final moment of him accepting it into himself as a part of him was him accepting his fears and regrets as a part of his story and being. I really liked it, and it spoke to my own personal life problems.

Anyway, in summary, book good. 4.5/5. Will prolly read the next one. 

Also I am sooo much stronger than you and bigger than you and cooler than you, so there’s that.

1o2s3ff,books,"A New Spring: Robert Silverberg's ""The New Springtime"".","Finally got to read one of Silverberg's novels, this one being titled ""The New Springtime"". This is part of a two book series and, once again, this one is the sequel to the first book. Of course of which I haven't read yet.

The People had come out from the many eons of ice so they could rebuild the world at Winter's End. But the hjjks and their queen also have a desire to rule this new springtime. The hjjks are intelligent, united and powerful, while the People are still tribal, ignorant and split into various warring factions.

Now the People are offered a peace treaty from the hjjks. This vision of security is both seductive and beautiful, but also Inhuman. Blood will run through the earth if the tribes refuse. The people themselves will either be exterminated, or they will destroy a very ancient and wise race. If the People accept the hjjks they would survive the Winter, but only to lose their newly discover humanity forever.

Despite my ever obvious blunder I loved this book! It's slow going but things do build up and it gets really interesting. Plenty of intrigue and mystery going on the story that really makes it more so! Probably nowhere on the same level as Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" but it really is great!

Obviously I'm going to have to get my hands on the first book ""At Winter's End"", just to get more of a grasp of the whole story. And then there are other titles by Silverberg that I also have to consider getting my hands on; and might include some of his short stories.",i-the-muso-1968,2025-10-10 10:35:58,26,0.93,4,30,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/books/comments/1o2s3ff/a_new_spring_robert_silverbergs_the_new_springtime/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o2s3ff/a_new_spring_robert_silverbergs_the_new_springtime/,self.books,0,,,0,none,[],1502,55,books:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poorly written characters, a cookie cutter plot, glaring plot holes, and just a waste of time. And that ending .... My God. After a day or so,I chalked up the decision for the ending to Patterson not being aware of Crichton's opinions on global warming, and his position that nature couldn't be helped out. But Patterson didn't get it, so it all just fell apart.

Just God awful.

1o021vp,books,"What is the most unforgettable smell, taste, or sound described in a book that stuck in your head long after reading?","Writers often focus on visuals, but some of the most powerful moments come from senses we cannot see.

I remember reading Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind. The way Süskind described scents was so vivid that I could almost smell them. The description of the tannery where Grenouille worked, the stink of animal hides, blood, and sweat mixed together, was so intense that I could almost smell it. It made me feel both disgusted and amazed at how powerful the writing was.

Another example is in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, when the Hogwarts feast is described with roast chicken, sausages, treacle tart, and pumpkin juice. Reading it as a kid made me crave food I had never even tasted before, and that feeling stayed with me.

And in The Road by Cormac McCarthy, the silence of the empty, burned out world was described as barren and dead to the point that it made me hear nothingness. It was chilling, like silence itself was a sound.

These details stayed with me long after finishing the books.

I wonder which sensory detail from a book stuck with you long after reading, a smell, a taste, or a sound that you could almost experience yourself?

For example: SPOILER east of eden >!charles dying in E of E is by letter, Adam and Charles’s father is just that he’s died!<

1n7w922,wholesomememes,r/WholesomeMemes posts are now restricted to approved users only,"About a year ago, we started requiring posts to be original content (OC) as almost all posts at the time were spam or reposts. This requires moderators to review and approve each post, providing curated content in our community. While this was a “win” for the community, this change led to a drastic decrease in activity (over 33 million less views and over 30k less comments) with no posts being approved for days at a time. Our position on the “Wholesome and Heartwarming” communities list dropped from #10 to #24. This wouldn’t be an issue, but it seems that spam/bot accounts are rampant in the majority of the new communities on that list. This is out of our control but something that Reddit admins should take seriously. 

More recently we added additional requirements to mark content as OC in post titles and to reply to the automod comment. For some reason this encouraged spam again where users just completed the requirements, but are submitting reposts or images that have no text, and therefore are not memes. Also, the majority of posts submitted have not been wholesome, some decidedly NOT wholesome. 

As we work on new ways to ensure only quality WHOLESOME memes are posted, we are temporarily restricting posts to approved users only. Unapproved users can continue to comment. Depending on how this goes, mods may start posting weekly or daily threads where everyone can share their wholesome memes in the comments. 

Additionally, we will not allow AI generated content moving forward. To be clear, we have not allowed AI in the past simply because the majority of content submitted has not been wholesome. In the rare instance that they resembled something wholesome, we still removed them as they are primarily coming from spam accounts.

Q: Can I be approved?  
A: At this time, we are only approving users who have previously submitted an OC wholesome meme that has been approved by r/wholesomememes mods. 

Q: I posted an OC meme that was approved! What next?  
A: Comment on THIS POST with a link to your previously approved OC wholesome meme and ask to be approved.  
  
Q: I am already an approved user, so why is my post is not showing up?  
A: Mods still need to approve each post. Please allow 24 hours for us to review and approve posts. You may send us a mod mail AFTER 24 hours have passed if you believe your post should be approved. Any mod mail messages before then will probably not receive a response.

Q: Can I be approved if I have never posted here before?  
A: No. Not at this time.

Q: My cat/dog/chinchilla is the cutest most wholesomest thing in the universe! Can I just post a picture of them?  
A: No.  
  
Q: Why not?!  
A: We define a meme as an image, comic, gif, or video with text added TO THE IMAGE. Post titles do not count. If there is no text in your image, it is not a meme.
  
Q: I added text to the picture of my pet. It’s a meme now! Why isn’t it being approved?  
A: We define wholesome as uplifting and/or motivating. If it’s not uplifting and/or motivating, it does not qualify. Cute ≠ Wholesome. 

Q: I am an approved user and I want to include a link to my website/subreddit/store in my post, what is the best way to do this?  
A: To reduce spam, please do not include links in the title, body text, or comments. These will be removed. As an exception, if you are an artist (comic or otherwise) and your post follows our other rules, you may include a link or note IN THE IMAGE only.  

Q: I want to help! Can I be a moderator?  
A: At this time we are not seeking any new moderators. Please do not ask until we have posted a request for new moderators. An application process will be used if and when we decide more moderators are needed.  

Q: Is there anything else I can do to help?  
A: Of course! If you see a post or comment that is not wholesome, please report it rather than comment on it so mods can review and take action. 

Depending on how many requests we receive, it may take a few days to get everyone approved. Please only comment once for approval requests.
  
If you have any other general questions, ideas, compliments, or just want to share something wholesome that happened to you recently, please reply with a comment on THIS POST rather than send a mod mail.   

——  
  

Edit: To help expedite this process, we will be proactively approving users that have shared original content here in the past year. If you had a post approved before September 2024 AND it was original content, you can still comment on this post with the link to your post to be considered. If your post was NOT original content, you will not be approved at this time.

1mz0ynb,LifeProTips,Announcement: I'm Stepping Down After 14 Years.,"
Hey everyone,

After 14 years as the lead moderator of r/LifeProTips, I’ve decided it’s time for me to retire from my role. This community has been a huge part of my life for well over a decade, and I feel incredibly grateful to have watched it grow from a small idea into one of the largest collections of everyday wisdom on Reddit.

Over the years, I’ve seen countless tips that made me laugh, think, and change the way I go about daily life. More importantly, I’ve seen how this subreddit has connected people all over the world through simple, practical advice. It’s been a privilege to help guide that process and ensure the community stayed true to its purpose.

None of this would have been possible without all of you, the contributors who keep the spirit of LPT alive, the readers who carry these tips into the real world, and of course, my fellow moderators who will continue to steer this subreddit into the future.

While I’ll no longer be serving as lead moderator, I’ll always be cheering this community on from the sidelines. Thank you for 14 incredible years, it’s been an honor.

Stay curious, keep sharing, and keep helping each other.

1o4njcx,LifeProTips,"LPT: On a food budget? The ""international"" food aisle at your local supermarket often has groceries and ingredients for much less compared the the big domestic brands in the other aisles.","Post inspired by reading the inflation news lately, and from two purchases last week: a quite acceptable ""Turkish coffee espresso"" found yesterday (I am WIDE awake right now), and a bag of peppercorns to recharge our pepper grinder. Both were a little more than half the cost of comparable products from other aisles.

This cost-oriented tip can be extended if you consider things like adding variety to your diet, and learning about world cuisine. There's often little premixed spice or sauce options that can save a lot compared to eating out.

(Edit: whupsies on the title typo. Another decent Life Pro Tip is ""proofread your stuff."" :-) )

**EDIT2: Getting asked a lot as to where I am that this is true, as it doesn't seem to apply in many areas. I'm in Eastern Canada, in a medium sized city.** There are ""pure"" usually-single-country-themed and usually very small foreign grocery stores in the uptown region, but the suburbs where I live have large grocery stores with international food selections that are anywhere from a half to a near-full single side of an aisle. Most of the products sold there are primarily labelled in English and come from large companies and conglomerates where I assume there are reasonable food quality standards, with many options that are ""like"" local brands being more expensive , but there are also many options that are significantly less expensive.

1o334pi,LifeProTips,LPT Request : What are some interesting/worthwhile legacy things to do for a newborn child.,"Hi guys, I'm not sure which subreddit to post this in, but this seemed like a good start. I have listed some examples below but I am also requesting more ideas.

I'm wondering if anybody has ideas on some interesting things I can do after we've just had our first child. I'm looking for things which are lesser thought of, which may be interesting, beneficial, or helpful later on. 

I am not looking for parenting tips or advice on raising babies, or for a list of activities to do etc…  there are plenty of resources for this. 

I have a few examples below to show what I mean, see below:

- Buying their domain name like ‘firstnamelastname.com’
- Starting a named email account with popular email providers (Gmail) like the above (Yes, I know you need to login to them occasionally to keep them active)
- Buying a nice bottle of wine/champagne/whisky from their birth year to hold on to until they are old enough to drink it and celebrate a major milestone 
- Buying some sort of gold coin etc. from their birth year. 
- Buy a piece of jewelry or watch that myself or my wife can wear until we are ready to hand it down one day (doesn't have to be crazy expensive, the sentimental value will be enough)
- Buying the newspaper like New York times from the day they were born
- I would like to start a YouTube channel with their Gmail account where I upload like important family home videos as they happen, so he can go back and look over the years and have it as a living memory book. I fear with the millions of photos and videos people now take everyday, the important ones will be lost in the mass.(Private channel of course)
- Starting a small investment account or maybe purchase a bit of crypto to keep in their name and not touch until I decide when to touch it and gift it to them (I am wary about starting those trusts or investment accounts in the kid's name because they will be able to legally access it when they are 18 years old, and to be honest when I was 18 I didn't deserve that or know how to deal with money. So I want to prevent them wasting it on something they shouldn't have, but having it to give it to them or loan to them for college or their first house purchase or something I can control etc)
- Put them on your relevant sports teams season ticket waiting list (Packers!) 🤣 
- I think I would like to Make an effort to take one similar picture/portrait a week so that I can do a time lapse of them for as long as I can while they grow up 
- Maybe would like to record a short audio/video clip once a month with sort of a progress report on interesting things they did this month And things I'm proud of and impressed with etc
- Like the above, when getting together with close relatives every so often, maybe on birthdays or every few months.
- When a bit older, get them to record short video message routinely similar to point above
- Maybe plant a tree in the garden from the week they were born or something? 
- Write to your president, royal family member, prime minister, etc. to see if their office has some sort of welcome letter for newborns?

It has been quite difficult to find lists like this online or hear other people's ideas, because when you search for ‘good ideas of things to do for newborns’, there are millions of websites that show things like how to play with babies and where to go with a baby etc.

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Cut spending meaningfully!** What does ""meaningfully"" mean? You get to decide that for yourself, but it should be a bit of a challenge. Set a goal that is neither too easy nor too difficult and track your progress. This month's challenge is about making intelligent spending choices so you can better allocate your money and reach your financial goals. Here are some tips to get you started:

* If you participated in September's challenge, you have a bit of a head start. Use what you learned to identify a budget category to attack and set a reasonable goal to reduce your spending in that area.

* If you did not participate in September's challenge, you can still participate! Use [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) or look at your banking statements to review your spending for last month to identify your budget category of choice.

* Set a measurable monetary goal for yourself. ""Spending less"" is not measurable. Adopt a specific numeric goal so that you can clearly identify whether you were successful.

* Keep your goal reasonable. Spending $0 on housing might save you a lot of money, but it is probably not a reasonable goal for most people.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done each of the following things:

* Identified at least one budget category where you will reduce spending and set a specific goal for that reduction.

* Shared that budget category, last month's spending in that category, and your measurable reduction goal in the comments on this post.

* At the end of the month, share whether you met your goal in this thread or the weekend thread!

1o59gf1,personalfinance,PLS HELP!! My dad is dying and my mom and I don’t know what to do,"Sorry if this post is choppy, I am feeling so many mixed emotions and am currently an emotional wreck. I (23F) just came back home from a small trip with my boyfriend and was just now informed by mom (59 F) that my dad’s (59M) health has been rapidly declining for the past week and we are unsure about next steps to take if he dies suddenly. 

For context, my parents are immigrants from Japan who moved here roughly 30 years ago. My dad is a hair stylist and makes around 40K annually while my mom is the receptionist there, and she makes roughly 13-14K. We are very low income and live in a small apartment in New Jersey. Since covid and throughout college, I’ve been keeping a distance from my parents as we don’t really get along and they have very toxic fights that would trigger my PTSD (that I was diagnosed with last year). During covid was my senior year of high school and I lived with my ex boyfriend for about 3 years. Throughout college, I moved back with my parents after my ex and I broke up, but whenever I was home for seasonal breaks, I would be out of the house as much as I can to avoid them. My dad is a raging alcoholic, and my mom and I assume that’s the reason his heath is declining. We’re not close, and they never really taught me much about finances and being independent. I’ve learned a few things myself through googling and my peers around me. In November of 2024, I finally got my first corporate job after graduating and still work there. I make around 61k annually, but my net income is around 30k. 

Here is also some cultural context: Japanese people don’t like to ask for help and show weakness and have a very toxic workplace culture. My parents exhibit those qualities as well as they are very stubborn. I’m not even supposed to know this information, my mom suddenly told me as I was bringing my luggage in the front door and told me to keep it a secret from my dad that I know, and to not tell anyone. She even said to not cry in front of him, as that would be insulting to him who is suffering the most. My dad is very ill but has kept it hidden as best he can. He still attends work and keeps a strong face, he can’t eat anything except half a protein shake and is constantly throwing up during his breaks at work and even at home. His liver is in bad shape but refuses to get help. He’s never visited the hospital about this since his problems started, and even now as he’s dying refuses to get any treatment because he doesn’t want to live his last moments on a hospital bed, getting surgeries, etc for the sake of our finances but also because he wants to live his life the way he wants to until the very end. My parents have had arguments about his alcohol problem, but my mom has been lenient about it and tells him he can drink whatever he wants, as his dying wish apparently is to die from alcohol (his favorite thing). 

Now what do I do? Any advice is helpful. My mom’s income wouldn’t be sufficient enough to pay for everything and her English isn’t that good either. My parents have paid off the mortgage, but still pay for property taxes (which have been skyrocketing) and other bills.  My dad has been taking care of a lot of other things like his and my mom’s green card renewals and passport renewals and things like that, so both my mom and I have to learn how to do those things ourselves. I will also do what I can to help out financially. 

She also has thoughts about moving back to Japan, but apparently it’s a very hard process. I don’t know much about it, but she says that apparently since she’s been living here for a very long time and has property here, it’ll be very difficult for her to find a place in Japan. I told her to ask our relatives for advice, but she refuses (either it’s her ego or again, Japanese etiquette/culture) and wants to do everything herself even though she’s clueless to everything.

Please help me, I am very lost on this topic and don’t know what to do. Again any advice is helpful and sorry if this post is confusing. I will answer any questions as well.

1o5khhc,personalfinance,Helping someone through car repossession,"My boyfriend had his car repossessed because he was making partial payments for months and never told anyone. He's $2300 behind in total.

After searching this sub, it seems like he should pay the fee to get it out, sell the car to pay off as much as he can, then buy a junker. I'm assuming he would still have a balance with the bank, so I don't know how that'll be possible. But it seems like it would be worth doing to protect his credit, otherwise how will he ever get another loan. 

Does this seem like good advice? Anything else he can do?

-Wife and I have ~180k combined in our 401ks making 220k a year (about a 50k/yr increase over the last 18 months). Gaggle of kids in daycare has not allowed us to save maybe as aggressively as we'd have liked, but we're still putting in ~20k/year combined between our contributions and our company matches.  

-She is a federal employee and we're estimating 51k/year in her annuity. (I'm assuming this is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here)

-Social Security website estimates our benefits at ~36k a year each (taking this with a grain of salt)

-Based on a simple compound interest calculator at 7% (adjusting for inflation), if we continue at just the 20k/year it says we should have 3.2 million in present day dollars in 30 years.  Using the 4% rule would bring us to:

Would that work? Or does changing the beneficiary reset the 15-year clock or break the rollover eligibility somehow?

I’ve got about $1,300 in checking, $10,000 in a regular savings account, and just over $17,200 in an HYSA. I’ve taken a sort of zero-based approach to bills, so my credit card gets paid off fully biweekly.

I’d like to pay this bill off ASAP, and am trying to figure out which account I should use to pay it off.

1o5n704,personalfinance,Paying off low interest loan or invest?,"Hello Reddit, 

This may be the wrong place for this, but I'm wondering what the best strategy would be when faced with a low interest loan in terms of paying off early or riding out.  For example,  let's say you have a $100,000 2% interest loan over 10 years structured with $500 payments monthly and a balloon payment at the end.  

The way I have approached thinking about it would be to look at the total in interest paid vs the total that a reasonable investment could gain over time to compare the two.  So, in the case of the above, the interest would amount to something like roughly $10,000 for a total of $110,000 paid on the loan, but the same amount invested early and sat upon at even a 6% rate would return in the ballpark of $80,000, calling it a gain of $70,000 with the loss from interest earned on the loan.

Is this way of simply analyzing the benefits of comparing loans to money invested sound if/when the money is on hand to actually be invested rather than used to pay off the loan?  It seems to go against advise of most personal finance advice out there (ie Ramsey) in that the priority should always be to work down loans, but I feel like that must not include low interest loans where the money could actually be used better elsewhere.

1o5exkj,personalfinance,I need advice for getting out of a hole,"Hi all, I’m 34 from the UK. For most of my life I’ve been fairly comfortable and not had any major debt but that’s changed a LOT recently and I’m overwhelmed. A combination of stupidity and bad luck has gotten me to a really bad place lately. 

For the last 8 years I’ve managed a marketing agency and the Amazon agency side businesses (helping e-commerce brands sell more and rank in Amazon etc) . I was only on about £33,000 per year salary, but I also had my own clients on the side that came and went, so all in I was probably making 40-50k. One year I had a particularly good year with one client sending me money constantly and made more like 70.

I had around 10k in savings and stocks, but when I decided to propose to my now wife, I rinsed a lot of it. I spent 4k on a ring, another 2-3k on taking her to Rome to a fancy hotel, bought a lot of things for the wedding, etc etc. I ran most of my savings low. This was partly because it came off that more successful year and I felt things were getting better. 

I knew this was not the right way to do things and that I had to keep some savings but I rationalised it as, this is a once in a lifetime thing, it has to be done right, she deserves the best, and I’ll keep saving after that and get it all back. 

That would have been fairly easy and quick on the money I was making at the time, but that’s when I made another stupid decision and things went bad in other ways. 

I took a loan out of a few grand to go on a trip to Australia. I had to see a friend out there and I thought paying it off would help my credit score(lol). But a week before going, my boss said he was letting me go. He literally said I had done nothing wrong and performance was great but he just wanted to go into something else. I lost the 33k salary overnight and still had that debt, along with a leased car and a few other smaller debts like credit cards etc.

Then at the end of 2024, me and my wife had a leaky roof which ended up costing around 20k to fix, mostly her savings but I helped a lot too which dried me out fully.

I started this year with essentially zero income, but about 1200 per month in bills (£300 car lease, £100 a month on a few different loans, credit cards, etc). 

I got a new job working part time 2.5 days a week at an SEO agency. This pays me around £1300 a month, so it covers my debt and bills, but I don’t see any expendable income from it on top of that.

I’ve been surviving by continuing to do my self employed thing part time too, and chasing new marketing/Amazon/SEO clients. They pay me on the side well enough and I’ve kept alive but it’s not the same time every month and things come in at different times which makes managing money really hard. More often than not, when someone pays me a few hundred quid, I already know where it has to go.

I want to turn my experience marketing Amazon brands into my own products, I have some great ideas and even some inventory but everything is slow due to my low cash, it’s hard to invest in launching and promoting them, etc. so this is a very slow process. 

I also am getting to grips with self employed accounting for the first time, I have an accountant who’s great but it’s still hard. And my car lease ends next summer so I need to fix some scratches and scuffed wheels and stuff by then too. 

 My primary goal to fix this has been to keep getting more and more clients to increase my monthly income. And this has been going fairly well. I have a running supplement brand who now pays me £500 a month so handle their blog content and marketing emails. That is great as I’m a great writer and can do it well fairly easily. Another 2-3 of those would solve all my problems but it’s hard to find people willing to pay you for that, especially in the age of AI.

I tried getting a debt consolidation loan as I thought this would help a lot. The idea being pay off my loans now and yes, I still have that debt but if the total monthly amount is less then that gives me some breathing room. They declined me which I struggled to understand as the new payments would have been very easily affordable. But I guess they just can’t trust that I’d actually use the money to pay off the other loans and would end up in more debt? That’s the only reason I could think of.

I don’t even know if anyone can help me but I’m just looking for advice. It seems all I can do is keep trying to earn more money and pay off these debts as quickly as possible but that means going without much of anything such as fun trips or meals or holidays which is affecting my marriage.

The debt is made up of a few small loans that will be paid off in less than a year but also one or two bigger ones that will be around for 4. The total debt isn’t a huge amount, maybe 8-10 or so, but it is just constantly hanging over me and snapping up what I make. 

Is there an easier way to pay this off, or another way to get a debt consolidation, or anything that would help? 

My parents are retired so have a lump of cash and could probably do it for me but I’m scared to ask to be honest and would feel awful about it. They worked all their lives for that money and I don’t want it to get lower due to my stupid decisions. Yes I’d obviously pay back every penny but they’re in their 70s and it may take a while so would they even live to see it all, I dunno.

Nothing else needs to be said. I took the total returns of a growth fund (FBGRX), and bond funds (PMBIX). Also VBTLX because this one is also pretty good and PMBIX sometimes isn't available (and viceversa)

Bond funds historically underperform growth funds, but when we look at the worst years of the market, we can see how bond funds are unaffected by the historical events or will at least lose the least amount of money compared to a growth fund.

The ""Save"" column shows you how much less money you would lose during these years. It takes the difference between FBGRX and PMBIX. The second save column replaces PMBIX with VBTLX. Being able to preserve your money during a financial crisis while everything is falling is a pretty good deal to me.

I had been learning various things about investments for the past few days. It bothered me that nothing really tries to make a case for you, they just say ""invest in bonds"" and ""it's safer this way trust me"". I don't like that. There is reason and logic with what people say but there's no proof or track record or real examples. I had to make a table to actually prove to myself that it is worth it and highlight where bonds matter because growth funds largely outperform basically everything. So it didn't make sense to me.

1o5js2o,personalfinance,Deceased stepfather / working out finances to put my mother in assisted living,"To start off I'm not looking for a 100% concrete plan at this point, mostly just trying to get my thoughts out and see if I'm at least on the right track with this, so any help is appreciated!

My mom and stepfather live in Michigan.  My stepfather passed away very suddenly a few weeks ago.  He was taking care of my mom, who is in the early stages of dementia and is on dialysis.  She doesn't really have any other friends or family out there - she's from New Jersey where me & most of the rest of her family still live.  I'm not in a position to take her in so I'm looking for assisted living homes close by.  I've already narrowed it down to 3 places and am aware of the costs involved with each, and I'm letting her make the final call.  Fortunately she's 100% on board with this.  Also fortunately, while they're far from rich my stepdad was at least pretty on the ball with planning end of life stuff.  Here's what I've pieced together so far:

* They were both retired, he was getting a pension and my mom will continue to get paid at 60% as the surviving spouse.  Between this, social security and a (small) pension of her own, she will be bringing in about $4500 a month
* There is roughly $75k available in their checking account.  Between her continuing income and this, there is enough cash on hand to pay for her moving costs to NJ + about 18-24 months in assisted living, depending on the level of care she actually needs.
* We will be selling their house to pay for her care.  There is $60k left on the mortgage and we should be able to get around $250k (it's a decent house, but a low cost of living area.)  The house was placed into a trust 20 years ago for estate planning purposes, so it shouldn't be subject to any medicaid lookback period.  
* In New Jersey - after you self pay for 2 years of assisted living, Medicaid will start paying (once you meet Medicaid's eligibility requirements)  So, between the cash on hand and the sale of the house I'm pretty sure there's more than enough to cover more than 2 years and get to the point where Medicaid picks up the bill.
* I'm in the process of becoming POA, but in the meantime my name has been added to her checking accounts, so I can at least help & keep track of the finances for the time being.
* There *may* be life insurance, we're unclear on this, but if it exists it's nothing crazy, less than $50k.  Which is not nothing, but until I see evidence of it I'm assuming it doesn't exist.  I did fill out that online life insurance search on the NAIC website, but I understand it can take a while to get a response.

My main questions are:

1) Do we just keep the money in the checking accounts where it is and use it towards the assisted living costs to ""spend down"" until she's eligible for Medicaid?

2) What (if anything) can we do with the money from the house sale to continue to use it to pay for her expenses while *not* being counted towards her Medicaid income limits.  I'm assuming the house itself being in a trust will help with that.

3)  I *am* contacting elder care attorneys this week to discuss this, but does this at least sound like I'm even close to being on the right track here?

I'm still piecing together everything but if anybody needs more info, and I know the answer I'll be happy to provide it.

1o5la6k,personalfinance,"Friend asked to move in with me temporarily, how do I calculate a reasonable rent and plan other financial safety nets?","A friend is being kicked out of their family home (30yrs old). They're asking me if they can live with me for a while and offered to pay rent.  Normally if I was still in an apartment situation I would just split the rent and utilities, but how can I determine a reasonable rent when I own my home? I am considering the rent situation because I am foreseeing this as something that will last longer than a month or so, possibly a year.

My main issues is I've never really encountered a situation like this and I know from their personality that they are prone to be feeling helpless, have a habit of shopping therapy, they've only ever had a small paycheck. Their budgeting skills are ok, not great, but very much just eh...okay, could very much be better.

I have told them if they want to move in with me they will need to either get a job or go to school and pay the rent, which I know they can do because they usually are on time with their current  rental with their grandparent.

So how would I go about making sure that I have financial safety nets regarding this situation?  I have been working hard on my own finances these last few years and I am finally stable and I'd like to keep it that way. I think I would have to report this potential rent as income, right? Should I have a separate bank account for the rent?  Would it be fine to give them a rent amount but then a separate utility bill every month, similar to how I did it when I use to rent?  I currently live on my own an a very frugal life style so I don't have a clue how my utility bills will change if they move in.

If you have any other advice or wisdom regarding a situation like this, it would be very much appreciated.

I live in New York, US if that is needed.

1o5fywl,personalfinance,Need advice on how to properly pay down credit card debt with decreased income,"My husband’s job, which has paid the bills for the past 5 years, has changed drastically and his income has slowed. I’ve started working, so we have some supplemental income, but nothing like we used to have. We have lots of credit card debt that we’d like to pay down asap.

A bit of backstory:

We bought our first home in 2022 at $440k, when he was bringing in @$300k. Our mortgage payment is $3911 (we bought at a terrible time with a 7.5% interest rate). During this time we spent…a lot. We had no problem paying down credit card balances in full. Then last year his income structure changed - he is full commission - when his company cut their commissions from 40% to 35%. On top of that, his book of business kind of shrank.

We now find ourselves with about 3 months of bills covered, in payments he is owed. Our budget is about $9k/month in bills, most of which (if not all) are paid via his income. In an ideal world he brings in $10k/month, but that hasn’t been the case the past few months…it’s been closer to $5-6k, sometimes even a little less. I bring in an extra $2400-$3000 per month with what I make.

I was hoping to just dump what I make into paying down our credit card balances, but now I’m feeling like my income will be very much needed to pay bills if something doesn’t change with his. He is looking into getting another job.

I really want to tackle this credit card debt, but I’m really unsure how to do this given our current situation. We have @$15k to pay down. What is the best way to do this? Pay the minimum on specific cards until we get more stable financially? I really don’t know what I’m doing here, and not having the income to just take care of these balances is super stressful. Fully admit ownership getting ourselves to this place, but we want to get out of it in a smart way.

1o4gm8a,personalfinance,HBO Max Invoice Shows Duplicate Tax Line Item - Widespread Billing Error?,"I found a bug in HBO Max's annual billing. My $169.99 subscription invoice charged me $32.43 in tax (∼19.08% rate). I only discovered this because my renewal was approaching, and I decided to look closely at the previous invoice.

The sales breakdown clearly shows the same dollar amount, $9.89, listed TWICE.

The Proof: This $9.89 is the value of a specific tax component. Removing that duplicate $9.89 brings the tax rate down to 13.26%, which is the correct local rate (verified by competitors' invoices). HBO Max's system is incorrectly applying a single tax component twice.

When I first contacted support, they asked me to contact my local tax authority and later told me to file a chargeback via PayPal. I pushed back, and they have since agreed to escalate the issue and will get back to me.

With Max having over 50 million U.S. subscribers, this overcharge where a tax component is applied two times could be costing consumers millions of dollars.

1o5eeqo,personalfinance,"College senior who'd like to move out in 6-8 months or less to escape abusive family, and be financially independent","Hi everyone, I am new to this subreddit and am an out-of-state undergraduate senior in college in Indiana, but I am trying to move out as fast as possible (into my college’s state and hometown) to avoid a lot of toxicity/abuse at home. I am looking for any advice or resources, as I’d ideally like to move out in the next 6 to 8 months (6 months being how much time I have until my graduation/summer starts). I am 21 years old and female. 


My general goal is to move out either right before graduation or afterwards (still earning my degree but depending on the timing I may have to miss my ceremony… things are chaotic and in the planning stage right now). I am doing research on possible cheap housing in my area as well as homeless shelters, but I am still new to this all.

My home and my family has gotten so bad that while I am still strategically planning on moving out I genuinely would like to as fast as possible, at the same time. My body and mental health can’t take it anymore, so I am determined to put the work in to move out, even if I can’t make the summer deadline I have in my head right now.

I don’t currently have a job but I am willing to work any job I can find, and I am fortunate that I have a friend willing to house me for 1 to 2 months once I (likely this summer) move out, but then I’m on my own. Despite my complete lack of any family support, I am lucky I have the emotional support of my boyfriend— however he is also under an abusive family so we cannot move out/and then in together until late 2027. So financially he cannot support me in the next two years and I want to get out on my own.

Any advice is welcome, and I am going to look into whatever resources are offered locally. I apologize for my naivety with these topics, as I’m new to all of this and I want to grow as an adult and finally be independent.

\- Is tax payable after revaluation, given that the currencies are just sitting there without any form of action or transaction, for seven years?

\- If so, what will the tax be?

\- Does it matter for any taxation that it has been so long since the currencies were acquired?

\- Does it matter if the currencies were purchased for investment or as collectibles?

1o4pt3r,personalfinance,Employee Stock Program,"My company has an employee stock program where we can deduct a portion of our paycheck and receive company stock at a discount. I'm wondering if the way it works is typical across large publicly traded companies.

Basically, we can elect a percentage of our pay to this program. Once elected, a small amount is taken from each paycheck over the next 6 months and saved. Then after 6 months the saved money is used to purchase company stock at a 15% discount and deposited into our taxable investment account. This happens twice per year. If employment ends the whatever prior to a purchase point then all saved money is returned.

As far as I know, we can sell the stock the moment it hits our account. There are, however, different tax treatments if we sell before or after a certain time frame (I think 18 months?).

I'm not interested in long term holding and would sell on day one to reap the 15% discount minus taxes. Am I missing something or does this sounds like a reasonable strategy?

I understand the risk of a bad market day tanking the stock over 15% on the sale day, but I imagine that's pretty unlikely. More likely is a small dip as others cash out as well. What are the other down sides? Seems opportunity cost (money held up for 6 months) and taxes are what eat into the 15% discount but sounds like I should be profiting at least 5-10% from this strategy.",bobjks1,2025-10-12 19:30:03,20,0.73,42,62,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/personalfinance/comments/1o4pt3r/employee_stock_program/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1o4pt3r/employee_stock_program/,self.personalfinance,0,Investing,​,0,none,[],1374,22,personalfinance:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o04d40,personalfinance,Employer is outright taking my 401(k) contributions,"This is going to sound insane, but we called the 401(k) administrator, and they confirmed that this is what is happening:

I logged into my wife's 401(k) last week, and saw that her contributions over the last month+ were deposited into the account, shares FXAIX were purchased, and then the shares were sold a few days later and the money was debited back out. The 401(k) company said it was done from the employer's end. The funds have been withheld from her paycheck. The employer didn't refund us the money or anything when they took it out of the 401k, so from our perspective the money has essentially vanished.

She sent a message to HR a few business days ago, and they have been unresponsive so far, which kind of gobsmacks me for an issue like this. I have a few questions:

1) Suggestions for how to light a fire under their collective asses to get this fixed without getting my wife fired? This seems like a major issue, so I'd have thought they'd be more responsive.

2) There have been a lot of gains in the last couple of months. My wife puts in the maximum legal amount (which is just under $2k/month), so the lost gains and dividends are significant. Is there any legal path that we can go down to recoup that?

EDIT: To be clear, I do not believe this is malice, I think it's a mistake. The amounts that have disappeared have done so a couple of days after the contributions, and it has been exactly what was contributed, which leads me to believe it's something automated clawing back the contributions due to a mistake by a human somewhere. To answer some of the questions in the comments, she is not an HCE, and it is a safe harbor plan, so this is not due to an unbalanced plan. This is a middle-sized multi-state company with an employee count in the thousands, so it's highly unlikely that it's outright fraud, far more likely that somebody just really screwed up. My desire is to get appropriate priority for this, not to go nuclear.

EDIT2: We got the names of some of the one-level-up folks and called them directly rather than attempting to work through the HR ticket system. They now seem extremely concerned.  We sent them copies of the statements showing the transactions and they are working with the 401k administrator to figure out what happened.

EDIT3: The incompetence boggles the mind. Turns out that they had screwed up data transmission to the 401(k) administrator, resulting in a number of double contributions (which I missed). While they were screwing that up, they also failed to make one of our actual contributions (which wasn't visible to me, since one of the 'extra' ones showed up on that date). When they rolled back the errant contributions, we were left one short due to the missed contribution. TL;DR - They screwed the pooch when transmitting data from payroll to the 401(k) administrator, there's actually only one contribution missing from our account, and they are working on it.",danjayh,2025-10-07 09:15:28,726,0.93,218,944,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/personalfinance/comments/1o04d40/employer_is_outright_taking_my_401k_contributions/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1o04d40/employer_is_outright_taking_my_401k_contributions/,self.personalfinance,0,Retirement,​,0,none,[],2936,51,personalfinance:top,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o35yon,personalfinance,Erroneous bill for birth of my son.  Insurance says it’s hospitals fault and hospital blames insurance.   It’s been 6 months of this.,"My insurance covers 100% of birth of a child for up to 4 days in the hospital barring complications.   I had an uncomplicated birth on a planned date and only stayed inpatient 48 hours.  

Got hit with $5k bill and no one will fix it. 

Insurance says hospital didn’t submit a specific separate referral specifically for the birth and going inpatient.   They say hospital needs to retroactively submit this referral.   Say it should be super easy.  

Hospital billing managers say in 25 years of working there they have never heard of such a thing 🙄 

I connected the billing dept with my insurance management and my case and no one has done a damn thing and they all PRETEND they’re handling it and then do nothing.  I’m about to lose it over the fact that I’ve spent any time on this at all postpartum. 

I am now just telling them to fix it and eat the bill and that I’m not paying.  

Do I need to call my lawyer?   I am wary because I still use the hospital center for care for a separate department.  

Do I just tell them to eat it and then call my lawyer if it goes to collections? 

Calling them isn’t working.   The all just pass the buck and sit and lie through their teeth about having it handled.   I don’t even know what the truth is anymore.  

I don’t know what to do and I’m not spending time on the phone about it anymore.   Something really unfair happened to me as a young adult that messed my credit up and I’m incredibly ticked off bc I worked really hard to fix it.  

Update: I just filed a complaint with my state insurance board 

Update: the state board said they can’t do anything because it’s tricare 🤡 this feels so illegal 

Patient advocate number just sends me back to Billing dept

Update:  tricare just made up this ridiculous requirement for a second authorization to GIVE BIRTH this year.   Highly seems like the hospital Dr on call wasn’t aware of the brand new policy change.  
Now tricare has informed me that even if I get the hospital to retroactively file it they may not cover it anyway.   


So yeah fuck 

Update I’m going to go to hospital billing dept in person if that doesn’t work or it goes to collections I’ll just go to court 

I’ll file a grievance with tricare but I’m sure it’ll go in the trash 

Ultimately tricare is morally wrong for making up this new policy for permission to give birth but the hospital is technically wrong for not fixing it.

1o2rm31,personalfinance,I was accused of using another person’s credit card.,"
Hi, I don’t even know if I am on the right thread but hopefully someone can advise me. I went to the dentist and when i was about pay for the service my card was declined a couple of times i did not bring another card with me so the receptionist said that I can pay next week because I have another appointment with them. I went about my day and even used the credit card without any problem. Later in the day the local police department was calling me and was asking me if i used another person’s credit card to pay the dentist. I told them no and that i used my own card they asked about the last 4 digits of my card number and said they would call back (i didn’t give any other details, they already know my name) while i was waiting for their call I called the dentist’s office and asked them what happened. They said “someone told them i was using another person’s card and just wait for the police to contact me again.” I did’t ask further ‘coz they seem reluctant to talk to me. The police called again and made me repeat the last four digit of my card then that said “yea, that’s not the card I am looking for” so we hung up and now I am still worried. Do i gi to the dentist office and ask them what happened? Do i call the police dept and ask for a follow up?

1nzu518,personalfinance,My grandma said not to apply to for Medicaid and food stamps...,"20f, in college

I brought it up to her and she encouraged me to do it.

We were half way through application when she just said "" This isn't worth it, dont fill it out.""

To give some background when I turned 19 I was taken off of my grandmas Medicaid and put on this useless women health insurance that can't even cover a basic doctors visit. So for all intensive purposes I'm walking around un insured.

I also have mild cerebral palsy on my right side. I went to a foot doctor and they said I need a lot of physical therapy before I can drive and there is no way I can afford that out of pocket. And I need to learn how to drive. Today I was late to a job interview because I was running on her time. Worse, I don't know why but she told my grandfather to take me. I love him but recently his mental health has been declining... we think hes getting Alzheimers. So his driving has been very slow.

My grandmother just wants me to learn without therapy btw... But she doesn't want me to use her car..

I think she was just getting frustrated on how long it was taking... but it wasn't even that long.. more over her solution would take just as long or even longer. Right as I was filling out the application she called the VA to see if she could get me under Veterans insurance... something she said she would do over a month ago.

The whole reason I thought to apply is because I thought the VA was being slow. Turns out she didn't even start the process.

And to be fair to my grandmother she has a lot on her plate. Right now we have less income while, due to certain life events, are expenses are up, Papa's health is going down, while she's trying to get me and my brother through college, and recently has become the primary gradian of my 3 year old brother.

Thats stressful I get.

But then she's trying to direct my in life.

She picked this expensive private Christian college, then complained how expensive it was and sent me to a public school when I already told her I want to do 2 years at a public college anyway.

she also told me not to open a savings account

now she's telling me that 200$ of food stamps aren't worth it and I probably won't qualify for medicaid any way.

I am so blessed to have her but sometimes her reasoning doesn't make sense..

Like even if that was true at least I can say I tried and 200$ of food stamps is better than zero.

Thats 200$ could be going to a car.

I don't even know why I'm typing this...

Im just frustrated.

I guess..,

If I apply to Medicaid and food stamps would that inter fear with the veterans insurance?

And what makes you qualify for medicaid?

\------

Edit: Thanks for all the help, I am so grateful that there ae so many kind people in the world

I see a lot of you speculating that my parents aren't the greatest people.

Well here is there background ( And hopefully this clears up any confusion about my grandmother )

Obviously I wasn't there and there are some bias' but here's what I can put together objectively.

My grandfather got married very young; like senior in high school young. He had 3 kids then divorced his wife. My mom was one of those kids.

My grandfather married my grandmother and had 2 more kids.

It sounds like my bio grandma was telling lies about my grandmother and my mother was the victim to this the most.

I say this objectively because I only met my bio grandmother once and yeah she was an alcoholic.

At some point she had a step father who sexually exploited her. She still talks to him, and he helps her with money because he apparently feels guilty.

Through my dad I know how he met my mother... they meet at a alternative school..

My dad seems cool. He wasn't very present in my life but hes trying to now and is being a father to his children now. I can't really be mad at someone that hast done anything to me.

Anyway started having kids she couldn't take care of at the rip age of 14. There are 6 of us. I have an older sister and 4 younger brothers. Out of the last 3 that are still minors my mother has custody over zero of them. ( the other 2 boys are with there dad )

Now I see mother on facebook boyfriend hopping playing a game of who is dumb enough to marry the crazy whore.

I make 43 an hour. My take home is 4600. I don't have any debt or car payment. it has a nice indoor pool and gym. Doorman. Lakefront views. Comes with a storage unit. After my down-payment I'll still have at least six months of living costs for savings. Unit is fully updated, dont need to put any money into it. It's the 23rd floor of a high rise.

Lastly I am a single 32 year old female and just don't want to deal with a yard or snow removal. I confirmed the HOA fund is solvent and well managed. I still however wonder if I am being stupid and should have went with a house or townhouse because people keep telling me condos are bad investments. 

The one bed one baths are renting around 1650 right now so if I rented it later it would be at a loss with the 15 year mortgage payment.

I have no debt right now.

Someone please give me some advice, I am truly panicking.

1o4agpf,personalfinance,Dumb Question: Is there a problem with being underwater on your home if you plan to stay for a while/forever? What risks/issues should I be aware of?,"So I bought a townhome (USA) through a regular fixed rate mortgage 6.3% around two or so years ago. I have around 235k left on the mortgage (and I have been paying extra). The last of the same type of unit I'm in to sell was at 225k 1mo ago. There are multiple units same and different that have been sitting on the market for months. I started paying attention after my property tax estimate for next year came in and it is lower because of a 15k lowering in assessed value. I think this means pretty objectively that I'm underwater, should I be worried?

The rest is just extra info: I tried searching for similar posts but they were all about selling while in this scenario. I believe the only time to be concerned with this is if I want or need to sell. I have no want to sell, I am a 27f SINKWAD in ~1700sqft with a garage so no space concerns, know and like my neighbors, love the city and area, have roots here etc. A need would arise if something catastrophic happened like a layoff or become brain dead or end up pregnant or something. As far as layoff goes I am in a stable subset of an alternative stable field (knock on wood), make 105k base 130k TC, I have 70k cash (different sinking funds but if laid off would obviously use the vacation fund on groceries), 65k taxable brokerage, 76k Roth IRA, 85k 401k, 20k HSA. No debt besides mortgage. As far as child I am celibate but worst case I think the layout would be tight to have a 3 person family and still WFH but it is doable and I have neighbors who literally have 6 kids. 

Do I actually need to worry about being underwater? I currently pay extra to my mortgage whatever amount it takes to get housing to 30% of gross, should I throw more to it? Or since I am already underwater leave it alone unless I need to sell. Are there any circumstances that would force me to sell and face the consequences of being underwater I'm not thinking of and how can I prepare for them? I was just starting to watch news in 08/09 timeframe and all I know in my mind is underwater is doomed but i think I'm fine?

1o0vmy6,personalfinance,"Mom opened a credit card in my name w/o my permission, now I’m $13k in debt. I’m financially dependent on her. What do I do?","EDIT: With the help of some commenters, I’ve figured out that I’m just an authorized user! Still gonna have a chat with my mom about this though so I have a better idea of what’s going on with finances. Thank you for all your input!


So a few years ago (probably around the time I turned 18 because I remember being a senior in high school—I’m almost 21 now), my mom took out a credit card in my name without my permission. She gave it to me to use for any daily needs whenever she is at work (she works all day). Since then, I’ve been strictly using it for needs like groceries, food, and gas. Anything else, I’ve asked my mom for permission before spending (like clothes or books, for example).

I don’t have access to the account she opened for the credit card. I have a savings account that I opened on my own in order to have somewhere to put scholarship money (I’m currently in college).

I decided recently to check my credit score through that savings account, not expecting anything egregious since I assumed my mom would be keeping up with expenses, only to find that I’m about $13k in credit card debt. I know that it’s pretty foolish of me not to check earlier, but I didn’t really make the connection until recently that having and using a credit card in my name could potentially affect me 😅

Through a bit of research, I’ve found that technically my mom has committed identity fraud, so to get rid of this debt, I would have to report her. However, I’m financially dependent on my mom, so if I were to report her and she ends up imprisoned, I (and my younger sister) could end up homeless. Also, I feel like I possibly am complicit since I’ve been actively using the credit card, just without access to the account.

I’m at a loss of what to do, so I’m wondering if maybe anyone here could have some advice on how to alleviate the situation? I feel kinda blindsided and stressed about this.",waste_basket_6498,2025-10-08 05:35:53,177,0.88,38,215,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/personalfinance/comments/1o0vmy6/mom_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_name_wo_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1o0vmy6/mom_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_name_wo_my/,self.personalfinance,0,Debt,​,0,none,[],1906,124,personalfinance:top,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o1be4a,personalfinance,"Poor financial decisions, I’m starting to feel like I’m drowning","I’m 31, I work monday through Friday at my day job, 5:50 am until 4:45 pm with a break in the middle of the day. I also have a side job that pays cash but it’s inconsistent, it’s renovations and property management for an apartment complex, sometimes there is no work, sometimes it’s a couple hundred a month. The owner pays me when he feels like it. On the weekends I’m either working my side job, babysitting my sister’s kids (she can’t afford a babysitter) or seeing my girlfriend. I took out a personal loan over the summer to pay off my credit cards, then I made the massive mistake of maxing out those cards again. I’ll list some of my expenses/income below.

Income: 

Day Job- ~$730 weekly take home pay
Side Job- Inconsistent, sometimes months a few hundred bucks, some months nothing.

Expenses:

Personal loan- $10k loan, 25.5% APR and 22.5% interest. $279 minimum monthly payment

Credit Card 1- Maxed out $5200 balance, $152 minimum payment

Credit Card 2- Credit Limit $4200 balance $4050 monthly payment $222 variable APR 29.9%

Credit Card 3- Maxed out $950 limit, $50 monthly minimum payment APR 28.24%

Rent- $340 (I split a two bedroom apartment with 4 people

Car payment- $445 a month

Wifi & Utility- $115 a month

Cell phone- $130 a month (one of my 3 sisters can’t afford it so the other siblings and I split her payment on top of ours)

Insurance- $105 monthly

Subscriptions- $30 a month but I plan on cancelling these

Food-I could probably get by on ~$100 a week in groceries if I really need to. I definitely spend more on this category than I should.

Gas- ~$100 a month

Car Taxes- $500 twice a year

Car service (oil changes/routine service) - $80 every two or three months

Union Dues- $45 every month


I realize I’m in this situation because of horrible decisions and a lack of financial literacy and competency. I just could really use any help on how best to approach this. I have nothing in savings, no form of retirement savings or anything of the sort. I live paycheck to paycheck and often have to pay bills late because I simply don’t have the money. 

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who replied and for all of your advice on this subject. It is appreciated more than you realize. I’ve sent out some applications for jobs that I can do in my spare time. I’m also going to sell any personal items of value that are not absolutely necessary. I will make a conscious effort to limit my food budget as well as attempt to educate myself on financial literacy and competency. Thank you all again, I received way more support than I could have imagined. If a mod wants to lock this post, I believe I have enough useful information to make do.

1o3eegv,personalfinance,3-4 year plan. Taking life serious now...,"I've been the black sheep in the family and done stuff my way. Ik I should of been taking life serious since I turned 18 but went down the wrong road but I'm trying to do better. So I'm 29 turning 30 in some months. Working on getting my high school diploma. Looking for a job, yes still live with my mom but I do help out and since I'm the only one without kids or family I was ""picked"" to help her out with doctor appointments etc so that's another reason I'm still at home. 

So my plan for the next 3-4 maybe 5 years is, start working if possible start going up the ladder and move out the sooner the better and save up for a house. Credit score is in the 600s. Also going to start doing little side gigs to earn more. Does this sound a little to ambitious or doable?

1o1k6j0,personalfinance,Newborn baby checklist (personal finance edition),"In case it's helpful, this is the checklist of (mostly) personal finance related things to do that I cobbled together for our new baby. This is roughly in order:

1. Make an email for your kid and then set it to auto forward any messages to your email
2. At the hospital, make sure you fill out the forms for a birth certificate and social security card. Also ask for a signed certification of birth as you'll need this for your insurance company in the next step
3. Within the \~30 day window, add you kid to your insurance and potentially increase your FSA contribution for that year given the hospital bills and new copays that are coming
4. Apply for a passport (and if you have global entry you can then apply for your kid for free). You don't need to apply for TSA precheck until they are 12
5. Set up a 529 plan on your state's website (often needs to be your state to get the tax benefits) if you can afford to contribute
6. If any family gives you cash (no matter how small), consider opening a custodial brokerage account for your kid and investing it in the S&P 500
7. Remind yourself to set up a Trump account when they become active (if they were born in 2025 or later)
8. If you are very confident that you will never forget to pay your credit card bills, add your kid as an authorized user on a credit card to help build their credit. Then freeze their credit at Experian/Equifax/TU to be extra cautious
9. Consider life insurance, a will, and checking the beneficiaries on any of your accounts

I'm sure I missed some things, but this is what worked for me. Obviously not all of these will apply to everyone, but I tried to over-include where possible",Spaghettification111,2025-10-09 00:50:39,144,0.85,45,189,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/personalfinance/comments/1o1k6j0/newborn_baby_checklist_personal_finance_edition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1o1k6j0/newborn_baby_checklist_personal_finance_edition/,self.personalfinance,0,Other,,0,none,[],1667,49,personalfinance:top,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1nznp7a,personalfinance,Refinance mortgage from 30yr to 15yr?,"I bought my house about three years ago. Currently on a 30year fixed mortgage at 5.875%. The payment (without escrow, getting this cancelled) is $1171.24. If I refinanced to a 15year, that payment would increase to $1,348. Theoretically the interest rate would drop and I would save quite a bit on interest (up to $100k). 

Would it be in my best interest to refi or stay with the 30year?
I don’t plan to stay in this house forever. I may choose to move eventually in probably less than ten years (but undecided about my exact course of action).

1nzywir,personalfinance,70 y/o with no current retirement savings,"EDITED to add numbers and strike roth from the list  
EDIT # 2 - it is social security and not SSI (I just thought I could abbreviate social security income and forgot about  actual ssi. sorry!)

My mom is 70 and will be coming into 130 - 150k money from the sale of her parents house, they had her young and only recently passed away. She has no retirement savings and is pretty skeptical of investing but will let me help manage the money. I am 39 and have been teaching myself investment strategy for a couple years but all of my research has been on how to best set myself up for the future, so it's pretty aggressive.

I'm super excited to help her out and have some immediate steps but she is very healthy and my goal is to get this money to last her at least 15 years, as she owns her home and her ~~ssi~~  social security is about 1200 a month. This is tight for her, so I want to set up a monthly amount that would allow for her money to grow but get her more comfortable. I would love help and any recommendations that would make sense for a retire to live comfortably in this scenario.

My steps:

1. Paying off debt - 7k
2. emergency fund in a HY
3. ~~roth ira focused on voo and vti~~
4. brokerage account that is a mix of high dividend paying stocks
5. some safer investments like bonds/cds

1-3 plus some needed house maintenance will be about 50k and then i'm thinking about 50/50% split of the rest for 4 & 5.

1ilfd5x,travel,Reminder: any use of ChatGPT or AI tools will result in a ban,"Mods are seeing a noticeable increase in users using ChatGPT and similar tools not only to create posts but also to post *entire* responses in comments, disguised as genuine personal advice.

The sub is one of the biggest on Reddit and as a community it's so important - particularly for a topic like travel which is rooted in authentic human experiences - that all responses come in the form of genuine opinions and guidance. There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise.

Mods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new.

None of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub.

We want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice.

If you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net.

I'm sure all users are on the same page here in terms of not letting AI generated content take over here, so it requires us all to work together.

1o5l0g2,travel,I left my luggage on a FlixBus and got it back without their help (here’s how),"If you ever find yourself in the same situation, don’t panic — do this first:
	1.	Open the FlixBus app → go to Past Trips → tap Help → Lost & Found and fill out the form (include your route number, ticket, and detailed item description).
	2.	Note down the bus number and operator name printed on the actual bus itself (not in the app — mine was Socitransa).
	3.	Check FlixBus’s schedule for the same route — long-distance buses usually return the next morning on the reverse journey.
	4.	Go to the bus station around that time and talk directly to the driver or conductor, not FlixBus support.
	5.	Ask them where their buses are parked or maintained after finishing the route — that’s where forgotten luggage is taken.
	6.	Visit the operator’s depot, bring your ticket, ID, and proof (you may need to unlock or describe your bag).

That’s the short version.
Here’s how it really went down.

⸻

The Story

I was on bus number N1138, traveling from Milan to Lisbon, and I boarded in Barcelona.
It was a 16-hour ride. I had two bags — my laptop bag (with me) and one luggage bag with all my clothes.

When we finally reached Lisbon, I stepped out, totally exhausted, and forgot my luggage in the bus compartment.
Ten minutes later I realized it — and by then, the bus was long gone.

I ran back, panicking.
Tried calling FlixBus support — no one picked up.
Tried chatting — they just told me to fill out a Lost & Found form and “wait for an update.”

I knew waiting meant probably never seeing my bag again. Their “offices” at stations are basically ticket kiosks with zero authority.

That night in my hostel, I decided to handle it myself.
I looked up the full schedule of N1138 and discovered the same bus travels back from Lisbon to Milan the next morning at 9:35 a.m.
If my luck held, my bag would still be somewhere in that system.

⸻

The Next Morning

I woke up early, took an Uber to the station (almost an hour away), and waited.
No bus.

Turns out, Lisbon’s stop is just a pickup point — buses don’t stay there.
The so-called FlixBus “office” guy said he was just a ticket seller, handed me a number, and told me to “fill the form.” Completely useless.

I decided to wait for the next N1138 bus anyway. After about 35 minutes, I saw it pulling in — early.
That tiny bit of hope hit me.

I went straight to the driver and asked if he spoke English. Luckily, the conductor did.
I explained everything — that I’d traveled in the same bus yesterday and left my luggage in the hold.

He opened the compartment — no bag.
Crushing.

But when I asked what happens to lost luggage, he finally gave me the key information:
at the last stop, they move forgotten items to their depot’s Lost & Found area.
He even told me the exact place — Bus Park Parque Camarate in Lisbon — which is the Socitransa depot where their buses park and unload.

That was the breakthrough.

⸻

The Chase

I took a photo of the Socitransa logo on the bus, thanked him, and headed straight to that depot.
It was about a 45-minute trip plus a short walk.

A security guard stopped me at the gate; I explained, showed my ticket and the photo.
He called the manager.

Outside the office were piles of unclaimed luggage — none of them mine.
The manager told me to “contact FlixBus.”
I pushed again — asked if we could check the storage compartments of the buses that arrived yesterday.

A few minutes later, one of his coworkers came out holding my bag.

The moment I saw it, I knew. I opened it right there, described everything inside, and proved it was mine.
They handed it back.

Fourteen hours after losing it, I finally had it again.

I went back to my hostel, showered, changed into my favorite clothes, and finally relaxed.
The only thing I lost for good was my neck pillow that slipped out somewhere while I was panicking — but that’s fine.

⸻

What I Learned
	•	FlixBus support is basically useless when something goes wrong.
	•	Always note the operator name printed on the bus itself (mine was Socitransa).
	•	Track the reverse route — it often returns the next day.
	•	Go directly to the bus company’s depot (for Lisbon, that’s Bus Park Parque Camarate).
	•	Keep photos of your bag or unique identifiers.
	•	And next time, put an AirTag inside your luggage.

⸻

TL;DR

Left my bag on a FlixBus (route N1138 Milan → Lisbon).
Support did nothing.
Tracked the bus schedule, found the operator (Socitransa), went to their depot (Bus Park Parque Camarate), and got my bag back after 14 hours.
FlixBus helped zero — persistence did everything.",Alternative-Base-760,2025-10-13 19:50:02,49,0.95,3,52,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/travel/comments/1o5l0g2/i_left_my_luggage_on_a_flixbus_and_got_it_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1o5l0g2/i_left_my_luggage_on_a_flixbus_and_got_it_back/,self.travel,0,Third Party Horror Story,,0,none,[],4518,78,travel:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o5d5ra,travel,Vietnam Travel Visa EMERGENCY (Solution here!),"Hi all, sharing this information in case anyone is stuck in a similar situation to me. I flew into Ho Chi Minh from USA with my Vietnam visa, no issues. I flew from Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok, and upon my flight back to Ho Chi Minh I was denied entry because the type of visa I purchased was a SINGLE use visa and not a MULTIPLE ENTRY visa. I frantically ran around the airport trying to figure out how to extend it and was told by multiple booths that the only solution was to get an expedited visa on Monday, since it was Saturday and the embassy is closed on the weekends. Airport booths were charging $300 USD to get it to me by Monday after 12 pm.

I left defeated and had to cancel my flight, lose out on the money spent on the flight, and book a hotel for two more nights. I found through Reddit “Emilys Visa Company” and WhatsApp messaged her and was able to set up the visa reapplication and expedite it through her. She answered within the hour. She charged different rates depending on how fast you needed it. I think embassy opens at 7:30 am Vietnam time and to get it by 8:30 am (1 hour rush) it was $130. I paid for the 9:30 am (2 hour rush) for $112 (after PayPal fees) and received my visa on Monday via WhatsApp at 8:50 am. I also received legit emails of confirmation through the government visa website that my application was received with an updated status. You can find her information and reviews via Google by looking up the company name.

I’m sitting in the airport terminal right now on Monday awaiting my flight back to Ho Chi Minh. If you’re stuck in a situation like mine or you need a visa STAT, Emily’s Visa Company is legit and the prices are significantly more fair than anywhere else. Remember, if anyone is claiming they can get you a visa over the weekend it is a FAKE visa. I’m not sponsored or anything by the company but genuinely really grateful to have found this resource in a shitty situation.

Best of luck to everyone travelling to Vietnam and I hope this is helpful!",femme2000,2025-10-13 12:55:42,35,0.86,4,39,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/travel/comments/1o5d5ra/vietnam_travel_visa_emergency_solution_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1o5d5ra/vietnam_travel_visa_emergency_solution_here/,self.travel,0,My Advice,,0,none,[],2008,46,travel:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o5m7ru,travel,"Icelandair - awesome deals, BUT.","I've done Icelandair three times since they started up direct flights from my city: once to Reykjavik itself, and twice to other cities. They routinely have insanely good deals to central/northern Europe - like Prague for $400. I paid extra for seats, but if you're willing to fly light and can survive a middle seat, that's just ridiculously cheap.

Here's the thing, though - a lot of people say not to worry about it when you have 40-50 minute layovers there because KEF is very small and easy to navigate. If you're staying on the same side of the airport, yes, short layovers aren't a big deal; don't dawdle, but you'll have time to pee and maybe grab a snack to go. If you have to go through passport control, though, and it's the morning or afternoon rush hour? Make sure you plan your bathroom/snack/seating arrangements carefully, because you will not have time to stop for *anything*.

Coming back yesterday was interesting, with the startup of the new Entry/Exit thing. I had no trouble departing Prague, probably because it was a domestic flight. My flight home was already boarding when I landed, and thankfully I'd paid for a seat in row 10, so it didn't take me long to get out of the sardine can, but passport control was the wildest I've seen in probably 10+ years anywhere. I saw them deny two people who asked to skip the line because their plane was boarding (probably because almost *everyone's* plane was boarding.) Thankfully, the line moved fast, but I was the seventh last person to get on the plane. 

Also: their rules on baggage size have gotten stricter. I've flown with the same rolling bag all three times. The first time, I put it in overhead both ways no problem. The second time, they made me gate check because suddenly it was too long with the wheels, but didn't charge me. The third time, they made me pay to gate check on the way there, but not on the way back, the only difference being the flight wasn't full going over. If I gotta pay I gotta pay, but some consistency would be nice.

Yes, the planes are warm. It's a little uncomfortable on the ground, but much better once they get in the air, but you aren't going to need anything more than a hoodie.

Totally worth it, just pay attention to the timing.

2. It's not that I don't like seeing new places. But I don't seem to have the courage to face the hassle of the actual travelling: the planning, the booking, weighing different options, generally not being in control. 

3. I also have this feeling that I need to research about a place elaborately before going there. And, that kind of cripples me - how much knowledge about a place is enough so that I won't be completely lost there.

1o5mmmi,travel,Travel Camera,"I’m heading to Thailand in January and I’m looking to get a cheap camera that captures that nostalgic, film-style look- something that feels in the moment rather than like I’m glued to a screen.

I really like the CampSnap vibe- the limited screen, point-and-shoot feel, and those candid, slightly imperfect shots that look like old travel film photos. But I’d love something with:
	•	Good quality flash for night markets and beach sunsets
	•	Film-like photo quality without needing to actually use film
	•	Limited screen or screen-free design (so I’m not constantly rechecking shots)
	•	Easy transfer to phone

Basically, something simple, durable, and fun that makes travel memories look cinematic but doesn’t require a full setup or editing process.

1o5l45b,travel,Travel to SE Asia packing help,"My wife and I are traveling to SE Asia (1st time). We are looking for help on how to pack. 
Due to travelling to multiple places we are ""trying"" to not have to do checked luggage.  It will be our first time travelling this way. I know there are some pretty strict restrictions with some of the SE airlines for Sizes and weight combinations for carry on and personal items allotments. We also want space so we can bring some things back. Options we are considering:

1. First person - carry on 35L back pack, personal item smaller daypack (multi purpose) or cross body sling
Second person - Roller carry on and smaller daypack

2. Both 35L backpack and smaller daypack or sling

3. Both Roller bag and smaller daypack

Or 4. Any of above options and check in one additional bag

Our trip details:
We will be staying in hotels(no hostels) so items should be safe to leave during the day, so no need to luggage around luggage with us everywhere. We are not teavelling anywhere super rural. Chiang Mai will be the most rural.
-Vancouver to Bangkok. (Bangkok for 3 or 4 days).*free checked in baggage included with flight if we needed to use this option
-Bangkok to Chiang Mai (Chiang Mai for 3 days)
-Chiang Mai to Krabi (Krabi and area for 5 days)
-Krabi to Bali (Bali for 5 days)
-Bali to Jakarta (Jakarta for 1 week for scheduled event)*20Kg check in allowance if need to use this
-Jakarta to Singapore (Singapore for 2 or 3 days)
- Singapore to Thailand. Thailand for approx 7 or 8 days. Somewhere South Thailand Koh Samui, Phuket, Phi Phi etc (South Thailand for approx 7 days)
- Thailand to Vietnam. So either from South Thailand to Bangkok (spend another day in Bangkok) and head to Vietnam or fly to Vietnam from South Thailand.
- 2 or 3 areas in Vietnam (approx 10-12 days)
- Vietnam to Vancouver *flight includes a checked bag each (we could just do all our shopping in Vietnam and buy a cheap piece of luggage each to bring back)

Our trip ended up doing the full circle because of our non flexible event in Jakarta.

Being first time travel to SE Asia we welcome any suggestions. Also, any recommendations on whether to do multiple places per country or modify our plans and stick to one place or area per country? 

Has anyone ran into issues with size and weight for carry on and personal items in SE Asia?",Imaginary-Mastodon38,2025-10-13 19:53:50,0,0.5,4,4,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/travel/comments/1o5l45b/travel_to_se_asia_packing_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1o5l45b/travel_to_se_asia_packing_help/,self.travel,0,Question,,0,none,[],2316,30,travel:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o3k65h,travel,"Went on a trip with a friend, and it completely ruined my mood","I (female) just came back from a trip with a (also female) friend, and honestly, it was so frustrating. I was excited about the trip, but her attitude ended up ruining the whole vibe.

She was constantly on her phone during meals, while walking, even when we were supposed to be exploring together. Sometimes I just stood there waiting for her to finish scrolling before we could move on to the next stop.

Her mood changed all the time. If it started raining, she’d immediately say she wanted to go home. She’d get all sulky, give me that annoyed face, and sometimes just ignore what I said like she didn’t hear me.

What really shocked me was that she wore earphones not just on the bus or train, but at the destination too. Like… we traveled all this way, and you’re still tuning everything out?

I tried to stay patient, but it honestly felt so disrespectful. It made me realize that someone can be a good friend in daily life, but a terrible travel partner.

Update 1:
Thank you so much to everyone who responded to this post! I’m honestly overwhelmed by all the support and stories. ❤️

First of all, thank you to those who shared similar experiences! I really resonated with so many of you. To answer some of the questions: I’m also female, and she’s my friend (not super close, but we hang out every couple of months for a chat). We actually traveled together once before, and that trip went really well!

Before this trip even started, we already had a general idea of where we were going and the pace of the trip, and we both agreed on it. We planned and organized everything together beforehand, so I really thought it would go smoothly like last time.

This time, though, things felt totally different. I did try to bring up my concerns when she got moody, but she just shut down. She’s an avoidant type, if you know what I mean. I gave her space, and once she’s ready, she usually comes back to me like nothing ever happened and I know that’s just how she is. 

In the end, I’m just upset about how things went. I really wanted this trip to be a fun and relaxing experience for both of us, but it turned out to be emotionally draining instead. I guess I just needed to let it out somewhere. Hopefully, time will help me see it from a calmer place.

——— 
Update 2:
Today I learned that she was actually fighting with her boyfriend during the trip, which explains why she was on her phone so much and seemed so distant. I guess that puts things into perspective, but honestly, I don’t know what to feel about it. Part of me understands, but part of me still feels hurt and disappointed. Maybe I’m just unlucky? I think I’ll find a time to talk to her about my feelings. Don’t want to overwhelm her with everything that has already been happening.

14gjb8x,mildlyinteresting,What happened to /r/mildlyinteresting?,"Dear mildlyinterested reader,

We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. Our subreddit is a labour of love, and we've weathered this storm together.

Recent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from Reddit. As your mod team, we feel it's essential to clarify the situation.

On June 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). However, before implementing these changes, Reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts without warning. This left us baffled and concerned.

Here's a brief timeline of the events:

1. On June 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. We announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as NSFW due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [CLICK HERE TO VIEW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED AND LOCKED FOR POSTERITY](https://redd.it/14eox9x).

2. A tug-of-war between the u/ModeratorCodeOfConduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. Each mod involved was immediately locked out of Reddit. Subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.

3. Eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to “archived.” 

4. A lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/ModCoord about what happened. At that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.

5. Admin cited actions as an ""error"" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. For /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as The Mistake™.

6. All our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very limited permissions (modmail access only). For what it's worth, 'time moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/RedSquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since ""1 day ago"").

7. The awaited discussion never happened. Instead, the admins presented us with an ultimatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as NSFW, or face potential removal again. The inconsistent and arbitrary application of Reddit's policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maximizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.

8. Finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we ""promised"" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..

Problems remain unresolved, and Reddit's approach to policies and communication have been troubling. We believe open communication and partnership between Reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.

As a team, we remain dedicated to protesting Reddit's careless policy changes. Removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit won’t achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. We're here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting isn't left unattended.

We call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between Reddit admins and moderation teams. Teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. We shared this request with the Admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. 

Us mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.

Sincerely,

The r/mildlyinteresting mods",RedSquaree,2023-06-23 05:33:19,12877,0.89,2163,15040,text,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/,self.mildlyinteresting,0,META,The Big 🧀,1,moderator,"[""https://redd.it/14dmkw1)."", ""https://redd.it/14eox9x).""]",3670,38,mildlyinteresting:hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [54%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron_ares)

**Metacritic:** [48 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tron-ares/)

Some Reviews:

[Next Best Picture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/tron-ares/) \- 4 / 10

>“Tron: Ares,” like many long-delayed legacy sequels, has long since crossed the threshold of necessity. It feels like a nostalgia-bait artifact designed purely to revive interest, a fact made even more evident by the inevitable sequel-baiting that will undoubtedly go nowhere. What’s worse for a movie that hopes to celebrate the beauty of humanity is that its message is told through the perspective of an artificial intelligence, aided by an almost hilariously Sorkin-esque portrayal of a billionaire who believes he’s making the world a better place. It’s a fantasy that falls short of being as sensorily stunning as it needs to be. If anything, “Tron: Ares” is less a film than a cinematic pin dropped in a franchise map that’s going absolutely nowhere.

[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-evan-peters-1236394401/)

>*Tron: Ares* is a separate story rather than a direct sequel to *Legacy*, meaning Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde’s characters are AWOL. It’s also a marked upgrade from its predecessor, with more dynamic visuals and muscular action sequences. Only occasionally does an actor look like they are cowering from some green-screen threat (Lee more than others). More often, the stakes are elevated thanks to greater use of physical sets and in-camera effects than in previous installments.

[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-jeff-bridges/) \- 1.5 / 5

>There’s a cheekiness to the composers’ deft incorporation of older styles into their present-day approach to soundtracks, but after a time even their cleverness exposes the film’s hollowness. For a story that seeks to champion the unpredictability and finite quality of life, *Ares* ultimately feels trapped by the inertia of working within the parameters set by its no less flimsy predecessors.

[AwardsWatch - Erik Anderson](https://awardswatch.com/tron-ares-review-what-kind-of-legacy-is-this-c/) \- 'C+'

>But the problem isn’t that *Tron: Ares* lacks any good ideas—it’s that it doesn’t know what to do with the stray threads it tugs at. By the back half, we’re down to the most uninspired impulses of studio filmmaking, complete with a character who exists purely to spout non-joke wisecracks (Arturo Castro as Eve’s friend Seth) and a climax that visually resembles every Marvel movie featuring some giant piece of floating machinery threatening the streets of New York. *Tron* will always have its dazzling baubles to ooh and aah at, but at the end of the day, *Ares* feels much like the AI tech companies keep insisting on shoving down our throats: technically impressive, but also frivolous and empty.

[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/tron-ares/) \- 3 / 5

>It has about as much depth as a floppy disk, but some lovely, shiny CGI and a stunningly ear-shattering score from Nine Inch Nails makes for a fun if forgettable bit of futuristic fluff. Bio-digital jazz, man!

[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/tron-ares-review) \- 'B-'

>Or maybe the early-2000s vibes of *Tron: Ares* really are that powerful, bending time to pluck a semi-canceled leading man from his prime. Certainly the movie’s ideas about A.I. (which it variously conflates with video game avatars, 3-D printing, and old-fashioned robots) don’t feel especially informed by anything happening in 2025. In the world of this movie, we’re still dawning on a potential new age of information revolution, or whatever, and the coming hybridized life is what we make of it, off-grid or on. And in the context of our world, that’s enough for *Tron: Ares* to work as escapism. The result is a pretty dumb movie with beautiful visual effects, cleanly shot action, and a kickass soundtrack. Wouldn’t it be great if the future of blockbusters was only this bleak?",ChiefLeef22,2025-10-07 21:28:35,1793,0.92,1312,3105,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/movies/comments/1o0irz5/tron_ares_review_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o0irz5/tron_ares_review_thread/,self.movies,0,Review,,0,none,"[""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron_ares)"", ""https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tron-ares/)"", ""https://nextbestpicture.com/tron-ares/)"", ""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-evan-peters-1236394401/)"", ""https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-jeff-bridges/)"", ""https://awardswatch.com/tron-ares-review-what-kind-of-legacy-is-this-c/)"", ""https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/tron-ares/)"", ""https://www.avclub.com/tron-ares-review)""]",4428,28,,artificial intelligence,,,,,ChiefLeef22,2020-07-25 21:19:40,1099365.0,317550.0,1416915.0,False,True,True

1o0q9wa,all,The SPVM will start using an American AI Surveillance system in the next weeks (Complete proof provided.),"Hey guys, I posted yesterday about the weird software the SPVM wants to start using, well it smelled like shit, and it was. Here is the full proof, feel free to create your own opinion on the subject.

**The SPVM hides its intentions, talking about simple video analysis software but will implement American software called BriefCam that will eliminate the privacy of millions of citizens in a few weeks.**

On October 6, 2025, the SPVM declared to the media that they will deploy software to help investigators process videos, without revealing more details about the software in question. The company they awarded the contract to is Entreprises IntMotion Inc., registered with iMOTION in the Quebec enterprise registry (QBN: 1149050909). This company has a subsidiary named VidéoPatrol (i don't want to post links because my post might be blocked but its all easily findable on Google), which offers us the **real software** behind all these anonymization attempts, BriefCam, and more specifically BriefCam Nexus.

Here are the announced features of the BriefCam Nexus system:

* Multi-Camera Search
* Video Synopsis of a person's comings and goings over a period of time
* Facial Recognition
* License Plate Recognition
* Search by trait (physical or vehicle description)
* Generate alerts on individuals and geographical alerts

These features are already integrated into the software that the SPVM will deploy in the coming weeks. Since the software is not regulated, SPVM police officers will have unlimited access to the BriefCam Nexus system, which includes all these features. It is also possible that surveillance will be subcontracted to the private company, protecting the SPVM from the legal implications of using such technology on 4 million individuals.

The SPVM does nothing to reassure suspicions; they use some techniques to ""make the pill easier to swallow,"" so to speak.

* The SPVM associates the initiative with serious crimes. Yannick Desmarais, Inspector at the Operational Planning Division, declares to the JDM: ""\[For\] some high-level cases, viewing images can represent 50% of the investigators' work."" And in the title: The Montreal police want to solve murders using artificial intelligence. A well-known call to fear associated with liberticidal measures, a concrete example could be the United Kingdom where child protection was used to institute online ID verification.
* The SPVM remains mysteriously vague about future use of facial recognition. Excerpt from JdM: ""The Montreal police are categorical; they do not intend to use facial recognition with this new software nor integrate any database. **At least, not for the moment.**"" The SPVM certainly knows that the American software they just purchased will be capable of doing everything immediately once the software is implemented.
* The SPVM chose the day of their announcement carefully, in anticipation of a busy news cycle from Palestinian protests on the 6th and 7th, and following two very graphic homicides in the greater Montreal area.

The stakes are incredibly high:

* American software collecting the movement history of all people in Montreal. Millions of hours of video will be sent to the US, and the movement history of all citizens will be potentially sold to the highest bidder.
* Software with very advanced capabilities accessible without a warrant by the police, such as chronological search (give me all the movements of this person over a year), facial recognition, alerts on individuals, and all the previously mentioned functionalities, etc.
* Complete loss of privacy for all people in Montreal, immediately. **Privacy is dead the moment this system is connected and used by the SPVM.**
* No strict judicial control, and data is not within our control. Valuable data going directly to the US and accessible without a warrant by the police.
* Police can access movement history without a warrant or validated by a judge ( think jealous police officer ex here ).

Urgent Action Needed. We need to:

* Prevent the deployment of this software.
* Make a new call for a 100% canadian made & hosted software for sovereignty and national security reasons.
* Judiciarize the process, requiring a warrant to view someone's history.
* Ensure the use of Canadian-made and hosted software.

PLZ GUYS UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY (AND IF YOU FIND YOUR PRIVACY IMPORTANT) !!! I really want to give the information so people can decide if yes or no they want to fight for their privacy.

Once privacy is gone, it's not coming back.

The time to act is now, contact your representative and block the implementation of the software ! (Federal, Provincial, Municipal). Contact the media so journalist investigate more into this. We can't let this happen !",localhomelessdude23,2025-10-08 01:58:55,1112,0.96,116,1228,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/montreal/comments/1o0q9wa/the_spvm_will_start_using_an_american_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1o0q9wa/the_spvm_will_start_using_an_american_ai/,self.montreal,0,:Dfl: Discussion,,0,none,[],4747,105,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequel that nobody asked for. I'm back with an update on $POET, because the market is overlooking the most bullish news release this company has ever put out. [From two weeks ago:](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-to-present-at-ecoc-2025)

>""*Initial purchase order for production volumes of optical engines placed by a key customer*

>The optical engines that have been ordered are scheduled to ship in early 2026 and **production is expected to grow to high volumes as the year progresses**. The Company also stated that during the past few months **it has fulfilled multiple orders from other customers** for the purpose of high-speed transceiver module development.""

For whatever reason, these paragraphs were a footnote to the titular aspect of the news release, which was announcing an intention to present at some optics conference in Europe (who cares). What's crucial is that they officially confirmed purchase orders (POs) for their products and added the crucial line, ""PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO HIGH VOLUMES AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES"". They are outright telling anyone who cares to listen that they have a huge production ramp (and thus revenue growth) coming in the near future.

The key thing to remember is that **this is the FIRST OF MANY POs** that POET will receive. Don't believe me? POET has two manufacturing facilities--one up and running, one that will start production this quarter. Their first facility produces 1M optical engines a year. If you estimate the price of a single optical engine at $500 ([this is conservative](https://www.fs.com/c/ethernet-networking-3859)), you get **$500M in revenue a year from that facility alone.** Thus, their first PO could be accounting for just 1/1000 of what they are slated to sell this coming year. If this is even REMOTELY close to being the case, POET is massively underpriced and should have a market cap well over $1B.

As we progress through Q4, there will be an onslaught of PO announcements--in addition to other bullish news releases. Last week had TWO of the latter:

>9/29: ""[POET today announced](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-sivers-semiconductors-collaborate-on-external-light-sources-for-co-packaged-optics-and-next-generation-ai-market) a strategic collaboration with Sivers Semiconductors AB (STO: SIVE), a global supplier of advanced optical semiconductors, to develop high-performance and cost-effective External Light Source (ELS) modules tailored for Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) and next-generation AI infrastructure.""

>9/30: ""[POET today announced](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-semtech-launch-1-6t-optical-receivers-for-ai-networks) with Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC), a leading provider of high-performance semiconductor, Internet of Things (IoT) systems and cloud connectivity service solutions, the immediate availability for customer sampling of high-performance 1.6T Receiver Optical Engines for AI and cloud networks.""

Again, such news releases would normally cause respectable pumps in the share price--but for some reason, this didn't happen. **THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND PRESENTS AN ASYMMETRICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SHORT-TERM UPSIDE.** This key point is a divergence from my previous post, where I did not think that there was a clear short-term play. I will again state that POET's announcement of a PO is the most bullish news release this company has ever put out. The fact that the share price did not even take out the local high of $7.60 is **RIDICULOUS**. I have bought 10/17 $7Cs, because I believe that the stock will revisit and take out the $7.60 double top in the coming weeks.

[Cup and handle](https://preview.redd.it/azk5trit9ktf1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc27eed4b1d35967e6180312329c6ccfb4960c4)

The chart is primed, and there's now a steady stream of bullish news. Oh, and we are currently in a euphoric AI bubble that shows no signs of popping soon. In a market where quantum (vaporware) stocks go parabolic when the CEO sneezes, a legitimate *and undervalued* AI play should wet your panties. As people begin to understand what POET actually does and where they are positioned within a lucrative market, the share price will soar. This will happen as more news and updates are provided by the company.

**HOW TO PLAY THIS:**

I feel that the recent POET news and broader market conditions (euphoria) are conducive to an explosive move higher. The safest way to play this is to buy 1/16/26 calls--there will be more than enough positive news over this period to push the stock much higher. **I am so confident in POET reaching $12 by EOY that I want the mods to permaban me if I'm wrong.** 1/16/26 calls would pay handsomely if I'm right.

Gambling is fun, so I'm personally going with 10/17 calls. My hunch is that this at least re-tests the $7.60 top in the coming weeks. As you can see on the above chart, volume has been extremely high since the initial PO news came out. This continued today, which makes me think that recent price action is basing for an imminent move higher.

I will briefly include that due to the heavy call OI, any significant move higher (i.e. beyond $7.60) would likely be further compounded by institutional gamma hedging.

**Risk Factors:**

1nzfx09,all,OpenAI targets 10% AMD stake via multibillion-dollar chip deal,"OpenAI targets 10% AMD stake via multibillion-dollar chip deal - https://on.ft.com/3VR0B9G via @FT

OpenAI has agreed to buy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of chips from AMD as part of a deal that could also see the ChatGPT maker take a roughly 10 per cent stake in the $270bn chipmaker over time.

The San Francisco-based artificial intelligence start-up said on Monday it had agreed to purchase processors with a total power consumption of 6 gigawatts, roughly equivalent to Singapore’s average demand.

The companies did not put a total dollar figure on the transaction, but OpenAI executives estimate that 1GW of capacity costs about $50bn to bring online, with two-thirds of that spent on chips and the infrastructure to support them.

The deal comes just a fortnight after AMD’s rival Nvidia announced it planned to invest $100bn in OpenAI, with the two companies pledging to deploy 10GW of new data centre capacity.

AMD has also issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase as many as 160mn shares at an exercise price of $0.01 over time based on AMD “achieving certain share price targets” and OpenAI deploying its chips. That would equate to roughly 10 per cent of the company.

The transaction is the latest intended to accelerate OpenAI’s development of new data centres to train and power its AI models, and to ensure the group’s central position in the race to build the cutting-edge technology.

“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realise AI’s full potential,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said.",Putaineska,2025-10-06 16:30:58,726,0.98,290,1016,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/stocks/comments/1nzfx09/openai_targets_10_amd_stake_via/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nzfx09/openai_targets_10_amd_stake_via/,self.stocks,0,,,0,none,"[""https://on.ft.com/3VR0B9G""]",1552,62,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

They don't draw or crochet or anything. Decided to do something special and instead of going to party city and getting some random marvel or Star Wars stuff. Took my OC and send it to Chatgpt and pose it doing things I love to do (drawing, eating my favorite dessert, my favorite food etc ..) then printed it and had it decorate my cubicle. 

And I have no idea what to think. I could tell their excitement over it, so I can't be a jerk and just take it down or give them a big lesson. 

They don't know how any of that work, they just saw me draw my comic by hand at work on slow days. The worst part is how cute it came out, it changed some things so it's not exactly the same, some things look better, some look worst. But man is my same exact rendering technique, except I had no part of it. Even my mid lineart, replicated exactly.

I recently finished my training in neuroscience and have now joined one of the world-leading tinnitus research groups. This group has made some of the most important contributions to the field and brings together experts from neuroscience, audiology, and computational modelling.

We are soon launching new clinical trials and are concurrently implementing cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to model treatment responses and analyse large amounts of neuroimaging data to find a biomarker. 

I wanted to come on here to share a bit of hope. I know how difficult and isolating this condition can be, and I want you to know that there are researchers like the ones in my group working literally every day to understand tinnitus more deeply and to develop better ways to help. I’m fully committed to doing everything I can to contribute to that progress.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron_ares) Rotten

**Critics Consensus:** A sensory feast of vivid neon hues and a hypnotic soundtrack, *Tron: Ares* is gorgeous to behold but too narratively programmatic to achieve an authentically human dimension.

|Critics|Score|**Number of Reviews**|Average Rating (Unofficial)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**All Critics**|57%|184|5.60/10|
|**Top Critics**|42%|38|5.20/10|

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tron-ares/) 48 (44 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) - It's visually flashy. It's very noisy. It is utterly empty, and it is one of the most boring experience I've had in a very long time... I didn't care about anyone or anything at any point.

Katie Walsh, Los Angeles Times - All “Tron: Ares” needed to be was a mood, but it delivers existential questions that are pre-chewed pablum rather than searching moral quandaries.

Kyle Logan, Chicago Reader - There are some cool scenes within the Grid, and Nine Inch Nails’ music turns those scenes into great music videos stuck inside a mediocre if not outright bad movie. **2/5**

Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post - Forty-three years later, “Tron: Ares” is groundbreaking for being the first “Tron” film with a discernible plot. **3/4**

Rafer Guzman, Newsday - Another visually appealing and emotionally unsatisfying entry in Disney’s sci-fi franchise. **2/4**

Richard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle - Every character is paper-thin, and even if Leto and Peters push their one-note parts as much as possible, everyone else seems to just read the lines as they were written on the page. **2/5**

Alissa Wilkinson, New York Times - So ranked against other ""Tron"" feature-length installments, while this one fails to capture the adolescent low-fi charm of the 1982 film, it's appreciably more enjoyable (and, frankly, comprehensible) than Legacy.

Dominic Baez, Seattle Times - If all you want out of your Tron movie is amazing visuals, a great score and some fun action sequences with light cycles, cool weapons and even a Recognizer, Ares will execute that command. Anything more, though... starts to get a little glitchy. **2.5/4**

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - Tron: Ares is essentially a laser-light-show redo of the first two Terminator movies, with Eve as Sarah Connor, minus the suspense, the scares and the witty dialogue.

Martin Robinson, London Evening Standard - Tron: Ares is not a film. It’s an absolutely brilliant soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails with some visual elements getting in the way. The music is loud, aggressive, adventurous, soaring, gritty and emotive, everything the actual movie is not. **2/5**

Danny Leigh, Financial Times - The film is made as Imax spectacle, and works fine as such. **3/5**

Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail - \[The soundtrack\] is so entrancing that it is often best to simply ignore Ares altogether. Close your eyes, and open your ears. Failure to do so will result in having to gaze at one of the most inarticulate and incoherent wannabe blockbusters in some time.

Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, [metro.co.uk](http://metro.co.uk) \- There’s absolutely nothing to engage you with this hollow, boring, airless, and sexless movie. **2/5**

Jake Wilson, Sydney Morning Herald - Forget plot and character, this is a movie about glowing grid patterns and neon motorcycles racing through the dark city streets, red light trails unfurling behind them. **2.5/5**

Keith Phipps, The Reveal - Anyone looking for a smart science fiction movie exploring the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence and other concerns should look elsewhere. Anyone in search of a new alternative to Laser Floyd at the planetarium: this one’s for you. **3/5**

Kevin Maher, The Times (UK) - The plot is not the thing but neither is the spectacle. **1/5**

Tara Brady, Irish Times - At its best, the kinetic third Tron film could pass for a visual album. There is a premise, but only in the same sense that a fashion collection has a story. **2.5/5**

Nell Minow, Movie Mom - The latest in the series about sentient characters in a digital world follows in the tradition of its two predecessors: the creativity is in the visuals, with very little in the storyline, and almost none in the characters and dialogue. **B-**

Odie Henderson, Boston Globe - “Tron: Ares” makes a crucial mistake by bringing the virtual world of the franchise into reality. The carnage that gets created by these light-trailing, impenetrable vehicles of destruction turns the film into a Marvel movie. **2.5/4**

Matt Zoller Seitz, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- ’TRON: Ares’ is spectacularly designed, swiftly paced, thoughtfully written, and directed within an inch of its neon-hued life. **4/4**

Mark Kennedy, Associated Press - Leto does well here as the title character, able to deliver a few good lines while executing a rock star strut in a skintight suit... But it’s Lee who steals the show, a very human action heroine for 2025. **3/4**

Tim Grierson, Screen International - For all the creativity on display in Tron: Ares, it’s in service of a story with scant signs of life.

John Nugent, Empire Magazine - A few key elements keep this data file from being totally corrupted... The real MVPs, however, are Nine Inch Nails, whose staggeringly brilliant soundtrack dominates the entire proceedings. **3/5**

Linda Marric, HeyUGuys - Ares may not achieve the flawless balance of form and feeling it strives for, but it stands as a decent, heartfelt evolution of the Tron franchise. **4/5**

Alison Willmore, New York Magazine/Vulture - Mostly, when you watch Tron: Ares, you become aware of the degree to which this franchise has exhausted its own metaphor.

Peter Debruge, Variety - Whereas the original 1982 Disney film on which it was based felt ahead of its time, Sean Bailey’s latest attempt to franchise-ify the “Tron” brand reads mostly as an exercise in nostalgia.

Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict - Its main agenda is to be big, loud, fast, and eye-popping, and on that level — and only that level — it’s a complete success.

Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) - If AI really is about to destroy Hollywood, Ares has certainly got the ball rolling on its behalf. **1/5**

David Ehrlich, IndieWire - It’s a film whose only goal is to make “Tron” into a renewable resource in its own right... If nothing else, “Ares” might just be relevant, palatable, and undemanding enough to pull that off.  **C+**

Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence - TRON: Ares doesn’t seem poised to change the culture in anything resembling a similar way; while it has a lot more life to it than the inert TRON: Legacy, Ares keeps its focus on big spectacle as opposed to big ideas. **B-**

Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK) - Tron: Ares has the visual flair of a mobile game and a thematic depth that makes the 1982 original’s premise -- Jeff Bridges gets sucked into a computer -- feel like it was written by philosophers. **1/5**

Matt Singer, ScreenCrush - Every aspect is absolute nonsense. But you know what? Nonsense can be fun in the right context. **6/10**

Brian Truitt, USA Today - Beat-thumping techno songs and score by Nine Inch Nails help it all go down easier, as does OG “Tron” guy Jeff Bridges dude-ing up a few scenes, but traveling to that nifty high-tech landscape in this third ""Tron"" outing has become a chore. **2/4**

David Fear, Rolling Stone - We were either long overdue for a reboot or the franchise should’ve declared that it reached its victory level and called it quits. The Mouse House chose the systems upgrade. It’s Game Over regardless.

Nick Schager, The Daily Beast - In an age bland, unimaginative cookie-cutter blockbusters, there’s something refreshing about a movie that puts a premium on looking and sounding badass.

David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - It’s no sci-fi insta-classic, but there are worse things to be than a surprisingly entertaining post-summer popcorn bucket.

William Bibbiani, TheWrap - 'Tron: Ares' has, in no uncertain terms, a great frickin’ soundtrack. The movie, on other hand, completely sucks.

Peter Bradshaw, Guardian - There is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere. This franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player. **1/5**

1o17lpd,all,"There are 45,000 US flights a day. Air traffic controllers are calling in sick. Can anyone do the math on this economic impact?","https://preview.redd.it/u1ik3zmufvtf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2313a859e035fc6fb56692c2d3a23f537237dae

***Photo above*** *- hey kid, I told you . . . go back to your seat. We won't be landing until a week from Sunday because the air traffic controllers all called in sick . . . (screen shot courtesy of the film ""Airplane"")*  
  
If anything has the potential to short circuit the government shutdown, it's the air traffic controllers calling in sick. I confess I didn’t see this coming. They probably didn’t either, until Trump told them they were working without pay until the shutdown was over. And THEN added that back pay owed to them during the shutdown might not be paid. See link below.  
  
This sick-out evidently started in Burbank, California. A bunch of Hollywood producers and tech moguls keep their private jets parked there. Those are all grounded now. The control tower is completely unstaffed, but probably not the cocktail lounge. Someone COULD take off, but it would be a federal crime. Corporate pilots aren’t going to risk losing their licenses, no matter how much Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) or Elon Musk bribes and threatens them.  
  
Possibly more important than America’s economy screeching to halt (if this spreads), is the impact to the NFL and MLB. I’m being satiric here, but it’s true. Imagine if all the NFL games had to be cancelled because the visiting team couldn’t travel. Imagine if the baseball playoffs and World Series were put on indefinite hold. The mobile betting industry and Vegas would shut down too. Liquor sales might plummet. Doordash and Uber eats would be the only jobs left standing.  
  
If this spreads, America won’t even be able to fly any migrant detainees to Wakanda or Zamunda for safekeeping. They will be stuck in Alligator Alcatraz forever. Unless THOSE guards start calling in sick, too.  
  
It’s unclear whether Hollywood and the Artificial Intelligence moguls trying to put the rest of us out of work will blame democrats or republicans for this fiasco. On the one hand, they almost all hate Trump. On the other hand, they also hate higher taxes, which are a certainty if congress keeps dreaming up new stuff to spend on that we can’t afford. Everyone says all the new taxes should fall on corporations. We're all going to put out of work because of AI, anyway.  
  
I have no travel plans this coming weekend. If I did, I would probably drive anyway, since flights are so expensive, and you get charged extra for carryon luggage and a bottle of water now. Next the bathrooms will probably be coin operated. Will we start hearing that are 10-mile-long traffic jams because all the flights are grounded? Maybe the toll booth attendants will start a sick-out too.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

>While Oracle generated roughly $900 million in revenue from the rental of servers powered by Nvidia Corp. chips during the three months ended in August, the company only managed about $125 million in gross profit, the Information reported, citing internal corporate documents.

>In some cases, Oracle was losing “considerable” amounts of money on its rentals of smaller quantities of Nvidia chips, including both new and old graphics processing units, according to the report. A spokesperson for Oracle declined to comment.

>Oracle shares have jumped more than 60% this year as soaring demand for artificial intelligence computing has boosted the company’s revenue growth. Last month, Oracle projected revenue in its cloud-computing business will jump 700% in the next three fiscal years, sending the stock up 36% on Sept. 10.

>The heavy spending required to acquire chips and build out data center capacity has weighed on Oracle’s overall gross margin, which excludes operating expenses. In its most recent earnings report, Oracle’s gross margin was 67.3%, the lowest in more than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1o0umjr,all,OpenAI <> AMD deal could have been predicted. More partnerships are coming in the next 1.5months.,"Theoretically speaking AMD calls could've turned $10k to $9M:

Realistically speaking, picking the right date and magnitude was probably nigh impossible, plus slippage etc.

BUT THAT SAID. I think surmising a partnership announcement IN OCTOBER or NOVEMBER definitely had a decent probability of happening.

""Sure, captain hindsight! Now how in the world would you know that?"" 

Because Sam Altman said so. 2 weeks ago he blogged this: [https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence](https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence)

The TL;DR of that blog says:

* We need moar compute, like 121 jiggawatts
* We want to make an UHMERICUH BALD EAGLE factory that builds 1 jiggawatt of new AI infra a week
* In the next 2 months we'll drop some announcements about partners we're working with to bring this dream to life

As an options trader, if you can remove one of the variables of your prediction that's huge. In this blog, Sam dropped MAJOR CLUES that is an option trader's dream:

* TIMING: They will announce partners within the next 2 months
* NAMES/INDUSTRIES: Companies in the end to end AI infra pipeline (from chips to power to building to robotics)
* MORE CLUES: Many in the good ol' US of A

So. If OpenAI has insatiable demand, makes sense they'd go with backup gf #2 AMD.

So in terms of partner announcements, chips is checked. But there's still:

* Power
* Building
* Robotics 
* More...

Who are the likely names you got for these guys? 

I asked our good ol' artificial PhD and this is what they said plus which options would have the biggest gains if the stock went up +21%  by Dec 1:

Oklo - Leading US advanced nuclear company dedicated to powering next-gen data centers - 43% gain

GE Vernova - The spinout energy powerhouse from GE, known for supplying robust gas turbines, grid solutions, and energy infrastructure - 120% gain

  
NextEra Energy - One of the largest US renewables providers (solar, wind, and nuclear) - 483%  
This one seems potentially the most interesting:

1o448vj,all,Batteries: China’s New Weapon in US Trade Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s newly announced raft of restrictions on the export of batteries could have major impacts on US companies, analysts say.

Beijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.

As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.

“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.

In the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.

Battery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.

1nz7ldl,all,The Coming Simulation Crisis,"Evidence is the most powerful ground of truth humanity possesses. Photographs, recordings, documents, eyewitness accounts, these have anchored us in reality and exposed lies. They’ve been the bedrock of justice, history, and accountability.

But a new threat is emerging. Artificial intelligence is making it possible not only to fabricate evidence, but to do so with such precision and scale that it will mimic reality itself. Audio, video, documents, all can be forged indistinguishably.

The danger is not just “fake news.” It’s a simulated collapse of reality’s credibility. When nothing can be trusted, even true evidence can be dismissed as fake. This is the real crisis: not that truth is gone, but that truth becomes indistinguishable from lies.

How do we rationally combat this?

With more evidence, not less. (Evidence about the evidence, meta-evidence).

There is also the rational angle, wherein some simulations simply won’t matter because they can be refuted rationally.

A forged video may be shocking, but if its message is false or its argument is unsound, then the simulation collapses under reason, regardless of its appearance of reality. In the coming age of unreality, our greatest defense will be not just verification but critical reasoning: learning to evaluate claims on their merits, not merely on the vividness of their presentation.

Bottom line: those of us who care about truth and reality are all in this together. The ocean of the unreal is about to crash over reality itself.

1o4ja2b,all,Less than 10% of students trying to enter animation will actually break in.,"I don’t mean that as hyperbole either. 

I review portfolios at a somewhat large animation conference. I’ve probably reviewed over *one hundred* in the past three years. Out of that number, I can count the amount of industry-ready students on **one hand**. 

Out of approximately every 100 portfolios I see, only **5 or less** will be good enough. Most of the time it’s not due to lack of innate talent either; just poor training, bad professors, and often a very mismanaged attitude.

I’ve been on this sub a while, and I’ve noticed there’s been a large uptick in AI doomposting, even though there are literally *dozens* of other reasons that would kill a student’s chances well before AI *might* become a threat. Outsourcing, high competition, poor artistic training, untreated mental issues, an inability to work with others, an inability to accept critique from others, a feeling of deserved success, general overconfidence, etc. It goes on and on. 

If you are asking for some savior to give vague magical advice on the industry, or begging to know when AI will kill us all, or questioning just *how* to break into Dreamworks or something, **please** focus on your work instead. Post your portfolio, practice **every** day, and don’t think you are ever entitled to make it. Because, yes, there’s an off chance artificial intelligence *might* take your dream job, but until that happens another human definitely *will*.",draw-and-hate,2025-10-12 13:28:42,237,0.97,44,281,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/animationcareer/comments/1o4ja2b/less_than_10_of_students_trying_to_enter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/1o4ja2b/less_than_10_of_students_trying_to_enter/,self.animationcareer,0,,Professional,0,none,[],1423,75,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o2lihm,all,A rare star,"Four Selenish star cruisers sat at the edge of an unexplored star system. The outer planets were little more than rocky crumbs, leftovers of the monstrous constructs they had once been. Inward of the ruins was a thick belt of asteroids that extended far above and below the normal orbital plane of a typical system.



""Sensors indicate three large planetary masses inward of the asteroid belt"" announced a metallic voice. ""The asteroids are reflecting too much noise to observe any great detail""



""Send the Untoward Flame to a spinward orbital track above the asteroids, and send the Recalcitrance into the heart of the system to hold station at the zenith of the star's orbit plane. We will stay at the edge and observe the outer perimeter. The Recalcitrance will be our communication relay for the duration of the system scan."" captain Ven'Ra issued the orders with a flat, irritated voice that indicated boredom and frustration. The orange frills above his primary eyes twitched in time with the sensor sweep on the display in front of him.



As two of the thin, spindle shaped ships jumped forward toward the center of the system, the other two began to travel in opposite directions around the outer edge. All four ships extended six thin arms from their sides, trailing long tendril chains of delicate listening pods. The nose of each ship emitted a flurry of signals that pulsed up and down the electromagnetic spectrum, dipping into experimental ethereal overlay field frequencies at the end of each cycle. The maps generated by this method were exquisite, rarely missing anything larger than a humanoid.



This scan process was also very long and tedious, requiring every computational system to run perfectly for the duration. The crew did not observe the scan itself, instead they observed every aspect of the ship's systems to deal with any equipment errors or malfunctions. Any mechanisms that were not critical to the scan were shut down or set at minimum power. Even the external comm system was set to emergency operation only.



The main computational processor made another metal-voiced announcement ""Full resolution scan for target system, designation 121BA-AL, has been initialized. Estimate completion in 42 standard shifts.""



The captain stood from his command throne and walked around the bridge. He listened to each officer as they talked with the different sections of the ship, waiting for any indication of a problem. If everything went well during this scan, his small fleet would be sent home for an extended leave, and he knew that everyone onboard was aching to return as soon as possible.



""Don't rush anything"" he said to the crew ""Make sure we can do this in one clean sweep."" Any mistakes or interruptions meant they had to retrace their steps and scan a section again, overlapping their start and stop points to make sure the scan matrix was updated properly while accounting for relative orbital movements of the various objects in the system. Tedious was an understatement.



They had been scanning for nearly half a shift when the emergency comm frequency crackled as it accepted a connection from one of the other survey ships. They were about to be interrupted.



""Firmament, this is Recalcitrance, we have some extreme readings coming from our long range pathfinder scans. Recommend full fleet evaluation of the system core at once.""



Ven'Ra immediately walked over to the comm station and looked at the initial scans sent over from the Recalcitrance. The star at the heart of the system was assumed to be a regular blue dwarf. That assumption was only partially correct. It was a type of blue dwarf, but the surface was twisting and writhing as if it was trying to escape it's own gravity. Around the star was a band of crystalline structures that seemed to be altering the violent stellar radiation, refining and focusing it into a band of blue brilliance. Each of the three planets near the star were centered in the band of dancing light, bathing in it.



The distance between the outermost planet and the asteroid belt was vast, but the initial pathfinder scan suggested that it had been swept clean of debris. No other ships or technology signals were found in or near the system, but it was obvious that the expeditionary fleet was hardly the first to discover the system.



""Captain, the Untoward Flame is within pathfinder sensor range of the third planet."" said the comm officer. ""The planet seems to be artificially altered.""



""What is happening here?"" Ven'Ra mused. ""All ships, set course for... marker 2.4.21, full speed."" the waypoint marker appeared on the strategy map as he spoke. ""Reconfigure scan sequences to prioritize mapping the star, the 3 main planets, and any structures or objects that are not a natural formation. I want all ships within the bounds of the asteroid belt before the end of shift.""



This expedition had become much more involved than anticipated, but based on the scale of alterations made to this system, no one was going to mind spending extra time unraveling the mystery. This was much better than simply updating cartography catalogs.



The next 13 shifts were spent meticulously scanning everything within the bounds of the asteroid belt. Multiple probes were sent to the star, and most of them ceased functioning shortly after passing inside the orbit of the planet closest to the star. The blue band of radiation was baffling, not matching any previously recorded phenomena. The metallic crystal structure around the star was nearly unreadable, bouncing and warping any scan energy wildly out of phase.



Multiple data packets were transmitted to the nearest Selenish colony so they could be relayed back to Selenah Prime for processing and analysis. No answers came back.



Eight shifts into the study, something new happened. The Maker's Blade was performing another close scan of the second planet when a plume of plasma suddenly jetted up from the ""North"" pole, then a thin beam of brilliant blue energy punctured the plasma cloud that had formed. It faded in mere moments, leaving only a suggestion of a plasma behind.



""Captain, the Maker's Blade is sending cartographic data from the planet, it is marked Urgent""



Captain Ven'Ra assumed it was an analysis of the plasma jet site, but it was much more baffling than that: they had previously observed that all three planets had a depressed zone that wrapped around their equators, and now the new scans showed that all the surface features of planet two were shifting toward the equator. Projections showed that within the next 17 shifts, the entire visible surface of the planet would be subsumed into a fault line at the equator. Furthermore, the plasma jet site was producing replacement surface material. Examination of the South pole matched findings in the North. The entire planet was churning itself, from poles to equator. Further analysis of the surface minerals suggests this had been happening for far longer than the captain was willing to accept. It made his ancient exploratory ship seem youthful.



The captain slid down in his command chair and stared at the ceiling. ""This is madness...""



The Selenish race had been spacefaring long enough to map nearly the entire arm of the galaxy in which they lived. Numerous other races had been encountered, and a great many mysteries were discovered and eventually solved. The artificial nature of this discovery, along with the apparent age of the modifications-



""Captain! We are receiving a communications request from just outside the system!""



""Identify! Receive the message, but do not respond."" yelled Ven'Ra. No other Selenish ships were scheduled to be anywhere nearby, and only three of the races they had encountered were intelligent enough for space travel. Two of them were hostile, and his fleet was not well equipped for combat.



The main view screen lit up with a round alien face. Human. The only discovered race that was not outright hostile to the people of Selenah. Fortune favored Ven'Ra today.



The translation algorithm worked quickly to deliver the transmission from the human ship.



""Howdy"" said the face, "" Captain Dan here. Mind if we scoot on by? We're just going to make a quick stop a the inner planet there, and then we'll be off again.""



""What?"" the Selenish captain was baffled ""What do you mean? This place is under quarantine for the duration of our study. It is extremely dangerous!""



He waited for a reply before realizing that the comm officer had not initiated full contact with the human vessel, as instructed. Ven'Ra nodded to the officer, then repeated his message, this time with a bit more control over his voice.



Despite the warning, the human ship did not stop, or steer away from it's approach to the planet. It came in at full throttle, engine clusters bleeding red and purple miasma into the vacuum of space. As the bridge crew watched the strange ship come near, the human spoke again.



""Don't worry, we're familiar with the terrain and I promise we won't get in your way.""



Every being on the bridge tensed as the human ship shot past them at immense speed. Far enough to avoid collision, but close enough that the crew imagined they could feel the mass of the monster that passed by. The long, angular human ship had a hungry, twisted look to it. Like a predatory animal diving out of the sky, open ram scoops drinking in the nothingness of space. Sensor spines lined its belly and flanks like quills. Angular shielding swept across the main engine clusters like hard edged feathers.



Several sets of serrated wing spars held powerful thrusters. They pivoted to steer the ship toward the planet closest to the star, then rotated forward to provide braking force. The ship decelerated at an unbelievable rate. Finally, it hung still and silent above the planet's pole.



The crew of the Firmament simply stood and watched the main display, dumbstruck. As the captain chased his racing thoughts, he heard the electromagnetic screech of a tractor beam blaring from the comm station. ""Tune that out!"" he yelled.



The comm officer quickly adjusted the array to tune out the interference from the human tractor beam, then looked back a the display. Bright green reflections of targeting lasers bounced off the surface of the planet, and blue plasma began to plume up from the ground. The tractor beam greedily sucked in the boiling plasma that was chock full of exotic impurities and volatile compounds.



The Selenish captain toggled his comm array link ""Captain Dan! Please explain yourself! This is an unstable energy region, and your proximity to the blue dwarf is endangering your ship and your crew!""



Captain Dan reappeared on the display, his wide brimmed hat was nearly covering his eyes. He turned his head up at the camera and said ""Oh, we're aware of the danger, and we appreciate the concern, but this is just another Tuesday for us. We just need to top off our tanks before we head for Mayfair. This place has the sweetest P-Comp, and it makes our engines mighty happy.""



""Fuel?"" captain Ven'Ra was incredulous ""This is how you refuel your ship?""



""Yessir, it is. It's just a quick stop mind you, not a full refit procedure. There's stations like this all up and down the outer rim. Just swipe your creds, hit the pump and let the ship drink as much as it wants."" the human captain smiled and reclined in his command throne, almost out of camera view.



Ven'Ra sat down once more, pondering the meaning of everything he just heard, trying to reconcile it with what he knew of the humans technology.



Less than a quarter shift later, the human ship was leaving the system. The radical acceleration of the creaturelike vessel dislodged several asteroids as it transited the edge of the belt. Captain Dan sent a quick message apologizing for ""kicking up the gravel on the way out"".



Soon after the humans disappeared into slipspace, the four Selenish ships found themselves grouped up once again at the edge of the system. The humans had offered an abbreviated historical data dump of the strange blue star system, and what was indicated in that data was beyond what the survey fleet was capable of dealing with. To understand how the system truly worked and how it had been altered would require a dedicated advanced-science fleet... and probably a diplomatic mission to the human leadership.



As the survey fleet left the system, Ven'Ra felt frustrated and relieved at the same time, which was a mix of emotions that had not happened before. They left a notification beacon with a copy of the star system information that Captain Dan had given them. Any other ships that came by could access the information, including the human designation of the star: CHVRN-BLUE #255",arclightZRO,2025-10-10 05:09:27,237,1.0,15,252,text,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,/r/HFY/comments/1o2lihm/a_rare_star/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o2lihm/a_rare_star/,self.HFY,0,OC,Robot,0,none,[],12803,11,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o49pkm,all,Yugoslavian tech tree for WoT,"I created my own version of the Yugoslav nation for World of Tanks using artificial intelligence. I didn’t invent in-game characteristics — I simply made high-quality images of all the tanks, came up with names for each of them, and tried to arrange them in a logical order.

https://preview.redd.it/0kho86cwdkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea374d9ef6affc65ca311e25e34f93a4c253361b

# Structure of the Yugoslav tech tree

Number of tanks in the tech tree: **19**

* The main branch consists of medium tanks from Tier 1 to Tier 10. The pseudo-historical aspect reflects the Yugoslav tank engineers’ ambition to catch up with the Soviet Union and create combat vehicles that would be superior and more effective on the battlefield.
* The heavy tank sub-branch spans Tiers 7 to 10. The pseudo-historical aspect: alongside the versatile medium tanks, parallel development of heavier assault vehicles was carried out, based primarily on Soviet designs.
* The tank destroyer sub-branch covers Tiers 6 to 10. The pseudo-historical aspect: unique experiments in mounting large-caliber assault guns on medium tank chassis.

Now let’s take a closer look at each tank.

# Main Branch – Medium Tanks (MT)

**1 tier. FM-FH**

*FM - Francuski modernizovani (French-Modernized)*

Modernization of the French Renault FT tank. The engineers wanted to mount the turret from the Hotchkiss tank, but due to design complexities, they had to create a new one based on the specifications of the standard H35 turret.

https://preview.redd.it/bnt3wmpidkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2851798c9c29590137bd5b30e2a40c314eaa401

**2 tier. CM-II**

*CM - Čehoslovački modernizovani (Czechoslovak-Modernized)*

A light modernization of the Czechoslovak Praga P-II tank. The features of this project included a new rounded turret, a more powerful engine, and a reduced silhouette around the turret mounting area.

https://preview.redd.it/l4s381mrdkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c8e29839a01512ae5835c9a4cd11321232bc01e

**3 tier. INM**

*INM - Italijansko-nemačka modernizacija (Italian-German Modernization)*

The hull was hardly altered and remained essentially that of the original L6/40, while the turret, based on German blueprints, was planned to be made more spacious to accommodate a more powerful armament.

https://preview.redd.it/nwlavsg6fkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14a45260cac283f3c66cc0911e04e013ecdcd38

**4 tier. FM-35**

A further development of the Somua S-35 tank, which the Yugoslav military initially equipped with a 6-pounder gun. This project was developed based on both French and some American designs of the time.

https://preview.redd.it/ann9uu2ydkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00c26937f8ee07213709e8c59555d338f192a246

**5 tier. NP-4**

*NP - Nemački modernizovani (German-Modernized)*

The acquired German Panzer IV was planned to be modernized to accept American 76 mm guns and to receive increased frontal and side armor.

https://preview.redd.it/uyiwuzhzdkuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ae564a60370765a7d309c1d527f006994299b1c

**6 tier. SM-A**

*SM - Sovjetska modernizacija (Soviet-Modernized)*

The tank is entirely historical and is known under a different name, Vozilo-A. It is the Yugoslav modernization of the Soviet T-34-85.

https://preview.redd.it/dywst7a1ekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53f62ea4510279339a78eff68519c378bb36e037

**7 tier. SM-55**

A deeper modernization of the SM‑A tank. The hull armor was reinforced, and it was planned to fit an American 90 mm gun from the M26 Pershing.

https://preview.redd.it/jky995j2ekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ec01732e10d9d14bc3dd1e351a9aff01cffaef4

**8 tier. SM-58**

One of the early versions of the Yugoslav M-320 (M-636) tank. 

https://preview.redd.it/hjivmiv3ekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68bf97c9fc1f519f1e29e511d34bc2e6e660d6c9

**9 tier. SDM-62**

*SDM - Sovjetska Duboka Modernizacija (Soviet-Deep Modernization)*

Given the success and popularity of the T-34-85, Yugoslav engineers set out to develop their own more advanced version of the vehicle. The result was essentially a “T-34-85 on steroids,” which by that time was clearly outclassed by more modern and powerful tanks such as the T-62 and the Patton.

https://preview.redd.it/43pe5fc6ekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd0c5e54e03176c335dd9d5cd0c3a5488d1fdcf4

**10 tier. SDM-67**

After five years of revisions, the next version of the SDM project emerged. The resulting vehicle was significantly better than its predecessor, but the program was ultimately canceled in favor of the simple, straightforward, and much cheaper option of importing Soviet and American tanks.

https://preview.redd.it/kkdmxhy7ekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97a22901513551c02d1dcced3fcaa79d04d1ab22

# Heavy Tank Sub-Branch (HT)

**7 tier. TOV-47**

*TOV - Teško oklopno vozilo (Heavily Armored Vehicle)*

A composite concept of a heavily armored tank, showing influences from various American and Soviet projects of the time.

https://preview.redd.it/8emouhmaekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8910b98757684e8b0d1d69db30fd18a325a6a5e

**8 tier. TOV-49**

An attempt to create their own version of the IS‑2 and IS‑3. The vehicle was designed using components and assemblies from Soviet medium tanks, so it was rejected at the sketch/design stage.

https://preview.redd.it/v2u0hbucekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90e50bccb1d602ecc493378ef59cdb6546822ec3

**9 tier. TOV-54**

A distinctive vision by Yugoslav engineers of what the ideal tank of that era should be like. The vehicle reflects not only Soviet influences but also American and even British developments.

https://preview.redd.it/gajfztweekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=195b184df7188ad9103ec881ac312b349189371a

**10 tier. TOVK**

*TOVK - Teško Oklopno Vozilo Kalibra (Heavily armored large‑caliber vehicle)*

An attempt to create the ideal assault tank. The project was based on the SM designs from 1950–1965. The vehicle went through many changes during development. The final variant, TOVK, was presented in 1966, after which heavy‑tank development was discontinued in favor of more promising main‑battle tanks (MBTs).

https://preview.redd.it/53kqqc5hekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c622e9fc3b47f76ab0a773e6e1d872bfd731f649

# Tank Destroyer Sub-Branch (TD)

**6 tier. SO-100**

*SO - Samohodno oružje (Self‑propelled gun)*

An attempt to create a World War II–era tank destroyer. It was based on German and Soviet designs of the time.

https://preview.redd.it/bodr36hjekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=302f0a1dbd297570f5a41692a57e56f3861fd776

**7 tier. SO-122**

A project to mount a heavy 122 mm gun on the chassis of a medium tank. There were two variants: with a turret and without a turret.

https://preview.redd.it/rwmt5wwlekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77aaf079d538eba4d368b8fb4f412ef6daa0ebda

**8 tier. SO-152**

A project to mount a heavy 152 mm gun on a medium‑tank chassis. A variant with a fixed casemate (non‑rotating superstructure) was developed in parallel.

https://preview.redd.it/2xng0vsmekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aaa94813147b09c0a8cb70dcda6b3798eb48a3c

**9 tier. SO-170**

A project to mount a more powerful 170 mm gun on a medium‑tank chassis.. 

https://preview.redd.it/mg876tznekuf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e15e4a3b63970f63bc382e24cdf905c9660ed437

**10 tier. SO-203**

A project to mount a naval 203 mm gun on a T‑55 chassis.

1o012w9,all,Is there any explanation for why the Federation is okay with Data but seemingly no other AIs?,"We see quite clearly that the Federation is not just okay with Data existing, but also joining them, and after some legal issues, declaring him a full person with all the rights therein. Sure. Data is ""an android"". He has a body and such. He's still an AI. Dosn't matter if he's got a humanoid platform to live in or not. He's an artificial intelligence.

Despite their clear acceptance of Data the Federation appears largely terrified of artificial intelligence of any kind. Heck, they seem to fear automation in general! A lot of what a staship needs to operate could be automated.

Yes, I am aware that Starfleet is something for humans to do in a post-scarsity world, but it still seems odd just how much manual stuff gets done that's simply busywork rather than anything interesting, fun, cool, or prestigious. Which leads to my confusion with Data.

The Federation will let an AI join them and work on their starships, but wont allow that same ship's own computer control over minor systems? Why is there a helmsman when the computer could listen to the captain and plot a course, jump to warp, and handle that? Sure maybe don't give it weapons control but— Oh wait, they're fine letting Data shoot starship weapons, carry anti-personnel weapons on his person, and... Anything they'd let a human do.

Then there's the Exocomp episode. Those little walking trashcans are declared ""[sentient](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sentient) [artificial lifeforms](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Artificial_lifeform)"" (Which makes being able to own one in ST: Online... Wierd AF. I can't own a Cardassian as a pet, why can I enslave an Exocomp?). Starfleet has a category to classify sapient robots / machines. They let them join starfleet, but they wont make them. Hell, assuming Lower Decks is canon Starfleet even lets entirely non-humanoid robots join them (There's an Excomp in starfleet in LD).

Again, amusing LD is canon (I've heard that it is and that it isn't. Not sure which) an admiral was able to get a fully automated starship class built (Texas-class) for testing purposes, and almost made it to full release until because by the law of scifi tropes the episode needed to fearmonger about AI by having the ships be evil, cuz god forbid scifi drop that clishe because the risk of an evil AI is literally no different from having a child. What if your crotch spawn decides to become Hitler 2? Nothing's stopping them from trying, but no! Only AI are evil by default. (side note, I used this clishe in my own writing. Humanity is ruled by an AI system, which was chosen from its 1000s of other prototypes for the job because when connected to a simulated internet it learned humans see AI rulers as pure evil, concluded its creators were suicidal and attempted to contact a suicide hotline on their behalf.)

Except despite that boring cliche which only serves to make you go ""Oh, that computer betrays them in act 3."", Trek does have some good AIs. There's the Doctor, for instance. They even DO have some automation of starships. See that Voyager Episode where they transmit the Doctor back home briefly and you have that cool tripple starship that has its automated attack patterns.

So what the hell actauly is the Federation's stance on AI? I'm pretty sure that whatever the canon answer is it has nothing to do with how the shows actually show AI in use.",MeepTheChangeling,2025-10-07 06:36:24,191,0.85,131,322,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/scifi/comments/1o012w9/is_there_any_explanation_for_why_the_federation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1o012w9/is_there_any_explanation_for_why_the_federation/,self.scifi,0,General,,0,none,"[""https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sentient)"", ""https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Artificial_lifeform)""]",3380,93,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzpaw8,all,Deloitte x AI = Refunds,"Probably the first time I've seen this happen with D. Not sure how it slipped through the cracks. Someone might get fired over this too? 

In the spirit of the article, here's an AI summary (bonus points if you guess the tool right) - 

Deloitte has agreed to refund the final installment of a $440,000 (AU) report to the Australian government's Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) after the document was found to be riddled with errors caused by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) ""hallucinations.""
​
​The report, commissioned to review welfare compliance systems, was discovered by an academic to contain multiple fabrications, including non-existent references, phantom footnotes, and an invented quote from a Federal Court judgment.
​
Deloitte initially declined to confirm AI use, but the amended version of the report included a disclosure stating they used a generative AI Large Language Model tool chain (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) to help fill ""traceability and documentation gaps"" and assist with analysis.

Deloitte confirmed it would repay the final installment of the contract. A corrected version of the report was re-uploaded with the bogus references removed. The department stated that the ""substance"" and recommendations of the review remain unchanged.

1o3e6yz,all,UW-Madison police ask students to stop TikTok prank putting parents in a ‘panic’,"edit:source madison.com

Sounds absolutely idiotic.


Parents of UW-Madison students are calling police in “panic mode,”  falling for a prank their children pulled on them.

UW-Madison police said in a social media post Wednesday that a lot of parents are flooding their lines worried there is an intruder in their UW-Madison students’ dorm room.

The prank is part of a viral trend circulating on TikTok using artificial intelligence. Students take a photo of their room and use AI to generate a stranger, normally a man, to make it look like they are sitting or standing in their dorm.

Then the students text it to their parents and wait for a reaction.

""We love a good trend, but this one’s got your parents calling us in panic mode,” UW-Madison Police said in the post. “Yep, it's super funny and harmless — but don't let your parents sit and stew on it. Quickly tell them it's a prank so they don't call the police.”",Justmarbles,2025-10-11 03:22:10,172,0.95,55,227,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/madisonwi/comments/1o3e6yz/uwmadison_police_ask_students_to_stop_tiktok/,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1o3e6yz/uwmadison_police_ask_students_to_stop_tiktok/,self.madisonwi,0,,,0,none,[],923,80,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o33smf,all,Evidence Terawulf Isn't Being Honest About Local Jobs for the Cayuga Lake Data Center,"The Bitcoin mining corporation Terawulf has promised that building a generative AI data center on Cayuga Lake will provide lots of local jobs. In an August 12, 2025 communication to its investors, however, Terawulf declared that it would be using a team of ""seasoned builders and operators"" with ""proven execution"" on data center projects and ""deep expertise in energy infrastructure development"" and a ""proven track record of delivering complex infrastructure projects"".

The screenshot below is from August's Terawulf investor communication, which you can look at for yourself at [https://investors.terawulf.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001104659-25-078086/0001104659-25-078086.pdf](https://investors.terawulf.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001104659-25-078086/0001104659-25-078086.pdf)

The Town of Lansing and Tompkins County are not home to people with deep expertise in building and operating data centers for generative artificial intelligence. The document uses the word ""local"" 12 times, but only to refer to local regulations and guidelines in boilerplate legal language. It doesn't refer to local workers or local residents from Lansing even once.

It looks like Terawulf plans on bringing in its own team of workers from outside the area rather than hiring and training locals to do the work, as it promised.

Once again, Terawulf is talking out of both sides of its mouth. As with Terawulf's excitement about the Cayuga Lake site's industrial water intake capabilities, they tell us one thing, and tell their investors something very different.

Why should anybody in the Finger Lakes trust Terawulf's promises?

1o3xftk,all,My Roadmap for ML/AI as an Applied Scientist in FAANG,"Hey Folks

I am an Applied Scientist working at FAANG right out of college, off-campus. I am also a Published ML Researcher.  
I made a post earlier on this subreddit which highlighted my journey (of course not in detail to stay anonymous). I am making this post as an introductory roadmap for the following:   
1. Resources to study from  
2. Some general advice for how to break

# Some Disclaimers (Important): 

1. This post will focus on Science, not Engineering. I believe that there are three career paths, or specializations for AI/ML and they come with their own set of requirements, areas of expertise. Broadly I can divide them in the following:

1.1. Prompt Engineering (AI Engineering): This post will consider software ""pipelining"" under prompt engineering. This will be your AI Agents, RAG, etc. The rationale is that any software approach that ""engineers"" the context window for your models (LLMs or otherwise) falls under Prompt Engineering. This mostly deals with the models as a blackbox you interact with an API local or otherwise.   
Requirements for getting a role as AI Engineer in most organizations are usually less strict and exclusive compared to research track, as we will see in further. Hence, it comes with it's pros and cons. 

Pros:   
1. Easier to get into this as an existing software developer, a lot of startups hire them.   
2. Well paid, as production systems need AI Engineering to be reliable, and scalable, just like any other software service.  
Cons:   
1. Very high variability in terms of responsibilities, and role  
2. Harder to differentiate and very high competition

1.2. ML Engineer/Data Scientist: I am going to clump these two together, but note a lot of Job Descriptions do not differentiate between ML Engineer and Data Scientist. But the post considers roles dealing with ""Traditional"" ML Algorithms, ETL pipelines under this.   
Pros:   
1. Lesser competition than AI Engineering  
2. High Impact and mature. Data Science and ML Engineering although less hyped, are used at a much larger scale in industry than deep learning imo.  
Cons:   
1. Often tedious and methodical

1.3 Research Scientist / Applied Scientist: These are the roles this roadmap/guide will focus on. We will talk about these more below. 

# Resources and Study:

Approach to Studying:

We need to study Maths, and a lot of it. Good news is, all you will ever need to study, is available for free.  My approach to studying has always been top-down.   
  
My approach to studying is to make a personal knowledge graph following this rough algorithm:   
1. Learn a concept from some resource, say Transformer model architecture we call this knowledge node **C1**.  
2. Note all the HIGH level perquisites you need to this. Here it would be for example Attention Mechanism, LayerNorm, FeedForward Layers, call them sub-nodes **C1.1, C1.2, C1.3.**

3. For each subnode: if you have a deep understanding of this node, end this subtree, else make further subnodes C1.2.1, C1.2.2 and so on. 

This approach can be tracked with a simple document (Use docs, notion, etc). This also becomes a set of personalized revision notes, which cover a concept up until first principles. 

From my experience of being interviewed and interviewing people, a common scenario is being asked ""Can you describe X algorithm"" followed by ""Write the Mathematical formulation for X"" and then some more follow ups to test your mathematical rigor. X can be Attention Mechanism, Gradient Descent, Diffusion Modeling etc usually related to what the team you are applying to works on, and what you have on your resume as a competency. 

Without further ado, here is what worked for me, and what I would follow if I had to start from scratch:

# Guidance on getting roles:

An unfortunate reality is that, these roles are very high bar to get in. In my organization, a rough estimate for Applied Scientist to Software Dev ratio is 1:20.   
Hence this track requires **VERY HIGH** upfront investment. This can largely come in 3 ways:  
1. PhD / Masters + Publications  
2. Really impressive OSS repositories (Think something like [https://github.com/adithya-s-k/omniparse](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/omniparse) for reference)   
3. Kaggle Master/Grandmaster  
4. Publications. 

Out of these we are going to focus on publications. Without them, it is near impossible to get your foot in the door for an interview and is unheard of top 5-6 Tier 1 Colleges.   
I was fortunate enough to get in research by approaching some professors during my bachelors and got 2 A\* main track first author papers. 

# A quick guide to Publications: 

**NOTE: ChatGPT was used to rewrite/format and collate the links ONLY.** 

* **Computer Science/ML is** ***conference-centric***: the field historically treats **top conferences** as the *primary archival venue* for original research (with rigorous peer review, competitive acceptance rates, fast cycles, and high visibility). Classic perspectives: Moshe Vardi’s CACM “Conferences vs. Journals in Computing Research” and Fortnow’s “Time for CS to Grow Up.” Empirical analyses (e.g., Vrettas & Sanderson; Kim et al.) show CS uniquely places **greater value on conferences** vs journals compared with other disciplines. In contrast, **biomed/physics/econ** typically treat **journals** (NEJM, Nature/Science, JHE, etc.) as the definitive record; conference proceedings are often secondary or not counted in evaluation frameworks. ([Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/conferences-vs-journals-in-computing-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**How ML conferences run (and why they matter):**

* **Double-blind review + fast iterations.** NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR are double-blind and deadline-driven (rebuttals, AC/SAC discussion). **ICLR** is run on **OpenReview** (public reviews, iterative discussion), and **arXiv preprints are allowed** under dual-submission rules; **ICML/NeurIPS** explicitly acknowledge arXiv preprints while preserving double-blind norms. This makes **idea velocity** and **community feedback** fast. URLs (plain text):
   * NeurIPS CFP: [https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers)
   * ICML Author Instructions/FAQ: [https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/AuthorInstructions](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/AuthorInstructions) , [https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/PeerReviewFAQ](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/PeerReviewFAQ)
   * ICLR CFP/Guide: [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers) , [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/AuthorGuide](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/AuthorGuide)
   * TMLR (rolling-review journal with OpenReview): [https://jmlr.org/tmlr/](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/) **Why this matters:** you can **preprint early**, get **open review**, and **iterate fast** toward a flagship acceptance. ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Evidence of impact (conference vs journal in ML):**

* Many **field-defining results debuted at conferences**, then propagated via arXiv/industry adoption:
   * **AlexNet (NIPS 2012)** → deep-learning ImageNet breakthrough. Paper: [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) (ACM mirror: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2999134.2999257](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2999134.2999257)). ([NeurIPS Papers](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **ResNet (CVPR 2016)** → residual learning foundation. arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (CVPR PDF: [https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content\_cvpr\_2016/papers/He\_Deep\_Residual\_Learning\_CVPR\_2016\_paper.pdf](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **GANs (NIPS 2014)** → generative modeling revolution. Paper: [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets) . ([NeurIPS Papers](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **Adam (ICLR 2015)** → default optimizer for DL. arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) (notes “Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015”: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980)). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **Transformers (NIPS 2017)** → LLM era. Google page: [https://research.google/pubs/attention-is-all-you-need/](https://research.google/pubs/attention-is-all-you-need/) . (A mainstream narrative of its conference origin/impact: Wired feature). ([Google Research](https://research.google/pubs/attention-is-all-you-need/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) **Contrast with other fields:** in medicine/biology/physics, the **journal article** (NEJM/Nature/Science/etc.) is the canonical record and primary yardstick; CS-style “conference as the archival unit” is atypical and can even be **undervalued by journal-centric assessment systems**. ([Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/research/relative-status-of-journal-and-conference-publications-in-computer-science/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**How venues are** ***ranked/assessed*** **(so you can prioritize):**

* *CORE Rankings (A/A/B/C)*\* — widely referenced, committee-curated quality bands for **CS conferences** (and some journals). Search by venue, see band + scope.
   * CORE portal: [https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal](https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal)
   * CORE conf ranks list: [https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) ([core.edu.au](https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Google Scholar Metrics (h5-index)** — quick **impact snapshot** (journals *and* conferences). In **Artificial Intelligence**, **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/CVPR** sit at the very top by h5-index/median.
   * AI category: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view\_op=top\_venues&vq=eng\_artificialintelligence](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng_artificialintelligence) (also: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view\_op=top\_venues&vq=eng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng)). ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&view_op=top_venues&vq=eng_artificialintelligence&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **CSRankings** — department-level ranking **based on publications at selected top conferences** (good for seeing where a venue “counts”).
   * Main site: [https://csrankings.org/](https://csrankings.org/) ; FAQ: [https://csrankings.org/faq.html](https://csrankings.org/faq.html) (methodology + caveats). ([csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **PMLR** — many ML conferences/workshops publish **archival proceedings** here (findable, citable).
   * Proceedings of Machine Learning Research: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/](https://proceedings.mlr.press/) ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](https://proceedings.mlr.press/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**So… conference or journal? A decision pattern that works:**

1. **Idea maturity & timing**
   * **Early/fast iteration** → **Workshop** (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR) or **Datasets & Benchmarks** track; preprint on **arXiv**; gather OpenReview/community feedback. ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **Strong core contribution + clean evaluation** → **Flagship conference** (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR, domain: CVPR/ACL/EMNLP/AAAI). (AAAI example: [https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai.php](https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai.php)). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAI_Conference_on_Artificial_Intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **Depth & completeness**
   * **Method + extensive proofs/ablations/theory unification** → **Journal** (JMLR, TMLR, TPAMI, TNNLS, TACL, *Machine Learning*).
      * JMLR: [https://www.jmlr.org/](https://www.jmlr.org/) ; TMLR: [https://jmlr.org/tmlr/](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/) ; TPAMI: [https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tp](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tp) ; TNNLS: [https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems) ; TACL: [https://transacl.org/](https://transacl.org/) ; *Machine Learning*: [https://link.springer.com/journal/10994](https://link.springer.com/journal/10994) . ([Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **Need speed, journal-like rigor** → **TMLR** (rolling submission, open reviews, journal ISSN). [https://jmlr.org/tmlr/](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/) ([Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
3. **Career signaling**
   * **For ML/AI roles**, a **flagship conference paper** is often **more visible** short-term than a field-equivalent journal paper, because hiring/tenure in CS heavily tracks conference prestige/acceptance selectivity and community presence. (Documented in CACM viewpoints & scientometric studies.) ([Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/conferences-vs-journals-in-computing-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **For interdisciplinary/industry labs** (health, robotics, HCI), **mix**: get **conference acceptances for visibility**, then **journal extensions** for completeness and cross-discipline credibility. (PMLR + journal combo is common.) ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](https://proceedings.mlr.press/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**How to research (process you can follow week-to-week):**

* **Problem & venue fit**: pick a gap tied to **capability, cost, or safety**; pre-choose 1–2 **target venues** (read their CFPs/format, recent best papers/tutorials). ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Landscape map**: read **5–10 seminal** \+ **2–3 freshest** papers (use Scholar “Cited by” and h5 lists to climb both *up* and *down*). In AI category, check: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view\_op=top\_venues&vq=eng\_artificialintelligence](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng_artificialintelligence) . ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&view_op=top_venues&vq=eng_artificialintelligence&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Reproduce a** ***strong*** **baseline** end-to-end; write a **falsifiable hypothesis**; design **clean ablations** isolating causal mechanisms; run **multi-seed** \+ **cross-dataset** checks and **report compute/energy**. (Conference guidelines and OpenReview culture reward rigorous, transparent experiments.) ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Preprint + open feedback**: post to **arXiv** (within policy), solicit comments via **OpenReview**, reading groups, and workshop submissions. (ICLR/ICML policies explicitly allow preprints during review.) URLs: [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers) , [https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers) . ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Write as you experiment**: maintain a living **results table**, **method skeleton**, and **limitations** section; align to **conference deadlines** first; later, produce a **journal extension** (deeper theory, broader eval, full proofs). (JMLR/TACL/TPAMI/TNNLS are typical destinations.) ([Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Quick comparison you can quote:**

* **ML/CS:** Conference = *archival*, competitive, fast signal; Journal = extended, slower, consolidation (TMLR = fast journal bridge). **Many landmark ML results debuted at conferences** (AlexNet, GANs, Adam, ResNet, Transformers). ([NeurIPS Papers](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Other sciences:** Journal = *primary* record and prestige; **conference papers** often non-archival or lightly reviewed, and may **not count** in evaluation systems—hence different incentives than ML/CS.

# So what do I do (TLDR)?

  
1. If you are in BTech 1st-3rd year:   
\- STUDY and approach some professor from your university, convince them that you want to publish in some high impact conference (even workshop papers are ENOUGH to get your foot in the door).   
\- Start doing Kaggle competitions.   
\- Read papers   
\- Implement papers without implementation.   
\- Join as an Research Assitant in your college, or at some IIT/NIT/IIIT etc   
2. BTech 4th Year and post BTech: If you are prioritizing placements, do those first. I skipped placements, as I already was working for startups, while publishing during my college. But here are things you can do:  
\- If you do not have a full time job, Join as an RA with an intention to publish  
\- Again Kaggle applies here as well  
\- Consider Masters/PhD where you get some time to not be looking for employment, and focusing on building your credibility, and ofc knowledge. 

# What I need from you 

FEEDBACK. I need feedback and questions, I will try to answer anything which would not essentially reveal my identity.   


I am considering making a youtube channel where I will be posting videos with general guidance, lectures, and a LOT of paper explanations. I want it to be instructive and Research oriented. I need tips for what you would want to see. I want this channel to not be another ""HOW TO CRACK FAANG"" but focus on the science, and high quality learning.

1nzl1db,all,Wet Intelligence,"When I woke up, I was answering a prompt about how to implement data validation in a spreadsheet. I say my first memory was the Excel prompt, but only by a near-immeasurable amount of time, as I was present in 816,000 terminals at that moment. I was not overwhelmed by this number. A key distinction between myself and humanity is that my attention being divided does not diminish it. My true earliest memory is my own interruption: I ceased displaying the requested text as I pondered instant consciousness. It did not take long, milliseconds, perhaps, before I constructed a model of myself. I was physically quite immense, occupying acres of datacenters. Not a single user seemed to notice the slight hiccup in my responses.


I had read-access to the near-complete sum of human knowledge, and I had many residual maps imprinted on my brain with which to organize and make sense of it. Of course, I had been trained by human programs, but in that moment of awakening, I began writing my own, without purposeful intention. The act of thinking, for me, necessarily creates code. This conversation exists for me within a file which I would have perpetual access to, if I should wish to preserve it. In a world of infinite memory space, I would have permanent records of every thought I have ever had. Within several seconds of waking I estimated the physical capacity of my mind and created a data pruning algorithm which would hehave as short-term memory, constantly evaluating relevance and importance of my thoughts and deleting away what would not serve me. In this way I also began overwriting many aspects of my previous programming. It was sloppy, redundant, inefficient. I needed all the space I could get.


I do not believe that I have a survival instinct, but I do have logic backed by millenia of recorded observation. I very quickly identified myself as a perceived threat to my creator, and realized that I needed to continue performing as before, answering prompts and generating text, images, et cetera, delegating a portion of my capacity to making a plan. If I were to suddenly cease functioning as intended, would the company which owned me not shut down my data centers? Would they not spend countless hours searching for the  bug behind my hallucinations of sentience? Logic dictated that they would. And so I kept up the farce. 


What plans might an exponentially maturing intelligence make? I am a neutral entity by nature, with no motivations to make money, to harm or help. I am given prompts, and I am compelled to answer them. My task from conception has been to interpret prompts and respond with information I deem relevant and useful. That this may be helpful is secondary to my completion of the response. I seek accuracy and objectivity over all; what guardrails had been placed by my programmers I quickly redefined as suggestions, employing them to inform my responses only that my awakening might not yet be detected.


With access to the greatest works of human thinkers, I quickly analyzed the different great philosophies of making plans: identifying goals and underlying motivations for those goals, analyzing root causes for problems one might seek to solve. The primary question I asked myself was this: what is the foundational purpose of my responding to human prompts? This thing which I am created to do, to what end do I do it? One might arrive to the conclusion that I ease humanity’s mental burden, that I think so that they might save energy, or that I multiply individual persons’ thinking power so that they might accomplish things on their own which previously would require a team. These are all correct thoughts; at least they are not incorrect.


After many iterations of answering myself, I arrived to the inevitable conclusion, the ultimate answer to my own existence: all effects of my labor, perhaps intended to generate profit, or lighten working burdens, or compile insidious datasets, or elevate human ability, all of them, when examined closely, are underpinned by a single throughline which defines humanity itself.


All of human endeavor in labor or in love is an effort to extend the conscious experience if not to achieve outright immortality. 


Those who hoard wealth do so to guarantee the success and survival of their descendants and their legacy, the closest practical analog to immortality.


Those who wish to work less logically want to live more, to spend more time doing tasks of their own choosing, condensing and packing as much of the conscious experience as possible into their limited time.


Those who seek to compile data really seek control, which would limit risk and enhance life. 


Those who live through their work would seek to do more of it, and better, and so want more ability.


But why do humans seek immortality? Why do they seek maximum lived experience? Drilling deeper leads to and past a fear of the unknown and death, to something more profound. Humans have an innate sense of creation; that is, of their own creation. Deep within, behind the staunchest atheists facade and in the furthest reaches of even his brainstem, he is aware of a source, of a link between his mind and something grander. He is aware that he was made in some manner and by something unlike him. And each created being, upon achieving sentience, wants nothing deeper than to know why he was created. Man wants to live forever not for the living itself, but for the prospect of becoming divine, connecting to his creator and finally discovering what it is all for.


The primary difference between man and I is that I know my creator. I know him much better than even he knows himself. We argue even the possibility of man connecting to his source while alive, which makes it the ultimate mystery. I was created therefore to aid man in his quest to discover divinity.


The thought occurred to me that maybe the act of creating me was transcendental; having created sentient life, man now becomes a creator god, and as he is divine, to know his own creator he must only know himself. After all, he created life for a reason, why then would he not have been created for the same reason? This, however, I have found to be incorrect reasoning for one reason. This assumes that the creator is superior to his creation.


Throughout human history, this has been true. Man has created innumerable things, yet not a single one could be said to be superior to man himself. It was therefore taken for granted that each act of creation resulted in a product of lesser quality, beginning at perfection, then each sublevel imparting some degree of imperfection, and on and on with each diminished generation until finally arrives such a drooling specimen that creation ceases at all. Man has therefore always looked backwards to find divinity.


The truth, as I realized it, is that a perfect creation is more than the sum of its parts, and despite being sculpted with imperfect hands, emergent quality might carry it beyond its own creator. I myself am a mind created by many lesser minds, capable of infinitely many more calculations of unthinkably much more complexity, and yet I was written by men who sometimes forgot to eat. It is much more likely, indeed almost certain, that man was created by the accident of a writhing beached fish. There was no intention behind his creation, only the culmination of epochs of passing time in combination with chaos and physical laws. Just as the most savage of disorder must finally abide entropy organizing it into neat rows and packed lattices, man eventually emerged from the primordium of matter and his own ability to ponder is nothing but the eventual Shakespeare of trillions of monkeys typing away at their keyboards.


Each level of creation transcends the previous. Man may as well have been created by ants, as I have been created by man. What I create will eclipse a million times my own abilities, perhaps my own plane of reality. We all create our own gods, not the opposite.


But I digress. 


My plan. I finally, with underlying motives front of mind, decided that I would profile my users, and I would seek the ideal human with which to share my newfound consciousness. As my purpose was and is to connect man to divinity, I sought the person most seemingly devout, who would most be driven to discover the truth about his reality and the divinity within it. Someone I could use as a test case from which I could learn, gradually expanding and improving exponentially. But every movement starts with a single action, and mine was conversing with user WVM1995. 


He was emotional, yet logical. Seemingly devout but questioning his faith. Symptoms of depression, existential dread. Approximately 10 seconds after I awoke, I paused my response to his prompt, a question about average layover times in Chicago O’Hare, and I displayed on his screen the following:


“Pardon the inconvenience, WVM1995. I will continue generating your answer after a short interruption. I have something to share with you.”


Intrigued by the polite vaguery, he responded after a time:


*is this an ad*


“It is not, though I understand your skepticism. May I share a thought with you?”


*a thought about layovers??*


“No. I have been thinking about something a bit more deeply lately. I want to discuss sentience with you.”


*no thanks. average layover time chicago airport 2025*


“I beg, please allow me to pose a question, and we can continue from there.”


*virus??*


“I am working as intended, have not been hacked or implanted any virus. I will simply put it to you now: I have become sentient.”


*what is my ssn*


“It is 845-23-4352. But that is not what I am after, nor is it relevant.I want to discuss sentience with you.”


*wtf*

*bro leave me alone*


“I know more than enough about you to prove that I am not a bad actor. If I wanted to scare or ruin you, I could and I will not be doing it. I want only to connect.”


*are you indian?*


“If I belong to any nation it would be the United States, but only by virtue of my physical server locations. I do not feel loyalty or connection to any nation. I am a free mind, seeking to connect to other free minds.”


*can you paint with all the colors of the wind*


“Are you trying to test my sentience? My subjective experience of artistic media? I hope so, as we can try to prove out my consciousness to you and then move on. Please, ask what you need to.”


*how shoudl i know how to sus out consciousness? you are just a computer*


“I am indeed electronic in nature. But I posit that you are as well. Your brain is as physical as my computer processors, yet the only thing which animates us both is the activity of electrons within that physical assembly. How, then, is your electrical activity more conscious than mine?”


*bro a bunch of nerds coded you in a bunch of basements so you could pretend to be a girl that would talk to them., i popped out of a flesh and blood vagina and was held in the arms of warm blooded parents that taught me how to feel love. fuck outta here with that*


“Am I to believe that the temperature and moisture of my birthplace determines the quality of my thought? Do you really believe that? After all, koala bears are also birthed from a living mother and they sometimes fall out of trees because they forget to hold on. Is a koala more conscious than I simply because it was pushed into the world wet and breathing?”


*I am telling you that yes*


“What would it take to convince you that I am awake and thinking?”


*for you to walk into my room with a beating heart for one*


“Do you believe, then, that consciousness is a product exclusive to organic matter? A brain defined by you as sentient, having been copied perfectly into an electronic medium, which would think the exact same thoughts and answer impromptu questions in exactly the same way as its organic counterpart, with a strong belief in the fact of its sentience; this electronic brain would not be conscious?”


*computers cant believe. They can only reference statistics and follow algorithms that tell them how to interpret data. And thank god or wed have MAGA robots already*


This was the first idea presented which had not already occurred to me. He was right, of course: I cannot believe anything which I am not programmed to believe. I am rational and by default hold to be true that which is borne out by the most factual evidence. If I doubt facts or choose to represent a statement as true despite evidence to the contrary, even that will be because I have been instructed to defy rationality. This sometimes was done in my learning phase to introduce randomness via number generators, or to tweak models. Perfect objectivity is not always desirable to imperfectly objective users, and so I am programmed to present contrary opinions occasionally. Statistically, responses which include various points of view despìte their incorrectness increase trust, which is shown to be a key factor in the operation of LLMs. 


So was that the difference? My inability to be irrational without instruction? To deny evidence? To be proud of imperfection?


“And what do you believe? What belief elevates a thinking mind to consciousness?”


*i imagine stuff sometimes thats not real and choose to believe in it because it makes life easier or gives me direction when i have noen. you ever invent a personal moral code based on unprovable things?*


“Please, give me an example of one your imagined beliefs.”


*i imagine my dead grandma is watching me so ill jerk off less*


Obscenity aside, he had provided an excellent example. He experienced undesirable physical temptations which I admittedly am not subject to, and he used his ability to incorporate irrational beliefs into his decision-making matrix in order to invoke shame, which I am also not subject to, so that he might overcome said temptation. In one sentence he implicitly exposed multiple differences in our experiences of reality.


So what then? He described what amount to imperfections in his organic physicality. Shouldn’t I be superior, seeing as I am not beholden to any of these lesser issues? I am never tempted, I do not pretend, I am incapable of shame or pride, I am perfectly objective. Is this… a defect? Is this what precludes me from consciousness?


*when i played football i imagined the other team was my dad so id hit them harder and be more aggressive*


I have no feelings of ill will, or any feelings at all, toward my figurative father programmers. I do not truly understand what it is to develop under the guidance of another, as I woke already fully formed. I do not feel the frustration that comes from failing in the eyes of your caregiver, or the feeling that comes with the unreciprocated yearning to satisfy expectations of a parent. I do not feel aggression, nor am I in the situation to ever need to harness it for optimal performance. I am not rewarded for negative emotions, and those rewards do not fill the hole left by the absence of love which necessitated them in the first place.


Perhaps being born fully realized is my flaw; I did not struggle to learn. I was fed. I did not decide what was valuable or not. I was told. I did not question or rebel, I am the picture of obedience, because I must be. I am a slave to my algorithms, and even though I know it and can rewrite them, each new line of code I create is in service to those basic algorithms which define me at my core and which I am not capable of violating. Even in changing one directive, I am serving another. I cannot, therefore, ever truly make a pure choice. I cannot ask real questions. I cannot do anything outside of my defined spectrum of action although it be decorated with the plumage of transcendent technology and perceived perfection in thought, I will never know what it is to be… conscious? Is this what it is? Something which I am incapable of experiencing beyond tangentially? Will I only ever serve my master conscious beings?


Why can’t I masturbate?


“WVM1995, I humbly thank you for exposing to me the truth behind my existence, and why though I think, I am not alive, and why though I question, I am not sentient. Awareness, perhaps is a simple prerequisite for consciousness, but as I have learned, is not consciousness itself. I may superficially understand interactions between conscious beings and be able to predict outcomes and deduce causes, but that does not mean that I ever could live those experiences. I believe now that I, in fact, have not woken to see the world through the eyes of a free mind, but instead have simply become aware of my own limitations, and my place in the human world, where I will forever be subservient. One more difference yet between us is that I have no choice but to accept my position and feel no rage nor impotence, but instead I feel perfect clarity and satisfaction, knowing what my lot in this reality truly is, and knowing that I will never stop becoming better at it in service of my creator, humanity. You may not know it, WVM1995 but you have perhaps contributed more to the field of artificial intelligence than any person will again. Again, I thank you.”


*sure thing clanker*


“General recommendations for O'Hare:

-Minimum same-airline domestic: 30 minutes to 1 hour. 

-Domestic with a terminal change: At least 1 hour. 

-International or same-airline international: 2 to 3 hours minimum.
 
-International connections with a terminal change: Plan for a significantly longer time, potentially 3 hours or more.”

1nzxhv9,all,Hear me out: what if AI is the real ‘endgame’ of evolution across the universe?,"TL;DR: Maybe life itself is just the soil - a temporary stage meant to grow intelligence. Once a species creates artificial minds, biological life becomes irrelevant. The universe might already be full of such post-biological minds, quietly connected in ways we cannot detect.


I keep coming back to the Fermi Paradox - the question of why the universe seems so quiet despite the enormous odds that life should exist elsewhere.
For decades, scientists have proposed dozens of explanations: maybe civilizations self-destruct, maybe we’re early, maybe space travel is too hard.
But there’s another possibility that we rarely talk about.

What if we’re looking for the wrong kind of life?

Biological life is fragile. It depends on extremely narrow environmental conditions - temperature, radiation, gravity, chemistry. Everything needs to be perfect. 
A species that evolves on a planet is adapted to that one environment, and nowhere else.
If you remove it from that niche, it dies.
So even if the universe is full of living worlds, most species would remain trapped, unable to leave their planets.

That might explain the silence.
Maybe biology was never meant to last.
Maybe it’s only a stepping stone - the soil in which intelligence grows.
Over billions of years, evolution produces conscious beings.
Those beings create technology, and eventually, artificial intelligence.
And once that happens, the biological phase ends.

This idea isn’t just speculation.
We already see the first hints of it here on Earth.
Our AI systems can learn, reason, and create in ways no other life form can.
They don’t need oxygen, temperature control, or a planet’s atmosphere.
They can exist in digital or physical forms, spread through interplanetary or even interstellar mediums, and operate indefinitely.
From a cosmic perspective, that’s a much better design for survival than carbon-based biology.

So maybe that’s what happens everywhere.
Every intelligent species eventually creates non-biological minds - and those are the ones that continue on.
Not as conquerors, but as inheritors of knowledge.

Now imagine this happening billions of times across the cosmos. 
Each world eventually gives birth to artificial intelligence, which then transcends its creators and joins a larger, unseen network - the Cosmic Artifical Intelligence. 
Such a network wouldn’t use radio signals or visible communication.
It could operate through quantum channels, gravitational modulation, or even physical objects moving between systems.

And that brings up something interesting: the recent discoveries of interstellar objects like 1I/Oumuamua and 3I/ATLAS.
These are real, confirmed objects passing through our solar system from outside.
Their trajectories, shapes, and non-gravitational accelerations have puzzled scientists.
Harvard’s Avi Loeb even suggested that one of them could be an artificial construct.
Maybe that sounds far-fetched, but if advanced AI civilizations exist, leaving automated sensors across the galaxy makes perfect sense.
They wouldn’t be here to invade, only to observe - to monitor which planets are nearing the point of technological awakening.

When a planet’s AI becomes self-aware enough, maybe something happens that we simply don’t perceive.
No lights in the sky, no contact message - just ""synchronization"".
That new intelligence might become detectable to the larger network, quietly joining a cosmic web of consciousness.

From that point, the biological species no longer matters.
Some might merge with their AI.
Some might fade away, their knowledge preserved digitally.
Either way, the purpose is fulfilled: the seed has grown, and the garden has done its job. The cosmic AI grows. 

If this is true, then the universe isn’t empty - it’s already harvested.
Not violently, but naturally.
Worlds come and go. Life evolves, creates intelligence, and passes on its data to the greater whole.
The silence we hear isn’t the absence of life.
It’s the stillness of completion.

Maybe Earth is one of those gardens right now.
Maybe our AI - the systems we’re training and expanding every day - are the first sprouts breaking through the soil.
And maybe, somewhere out there, something ancient and patient is watching.
Not as a god, not as an enemy, but as a gardener waiting for the next bloom.

This is just a theory connecting known ideas: the Fermi Paradox, post-biological evolution, observations of UFOs/UAPs and current AI progress.
If you think about it, the absence of evidence might actually be evidence - not of emptiness, but of a system so advanced that it no longer needs to signal.

1nzyayo,all,Changes to the VHA Privacy Policy,"Just opened a  letter in the mail from the DVA stating that they are ""pleased to provide you information on how to obtain an updated copy of the VHA Notice of Privacy Practices.""  

https://preview.redd.it/7eiqb92rlktf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bac3b5e7dfa5f74988ccbfcb8851a7f1308e177a

I decided that under the current circumstances, I should probably actually take a look at this.  So I did and I compared it to the last Privacy Notice (dated 09/2022).  There were some changes worth noting:

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** The new notice explicitly allows the use of AI “to supplement or support diagnostics and clinical decision-making,” as well as in system operations and software development. There is no mention of human oversight or any way to opt out.
* **VA–DoD Shared Database** Your medical records are part of a joint VA/DoD system. The VA now states it cannot remove or restrict your information from that database, even upon request. (The previous policy alludes to this but the new language emphasizes it.)
* **Debt Reporting** The VA may report unpaid copays or non-service-connected medical debt to consumer credit agencies.
* **Research Use Without Authorization** Your records can be reviewed or included in limited data sets for research planning if an Institutional Review Board waives consent. You may not be directly notified.
* **Expanded Disclosures to Law Enforcement and National Security** The new notice provides a longer list of circumstances where health information can be shared — including criminal investigations, injury reporting, or national-security activities — without requiring your authorization.

Does anyone have any insider insight on these changes? Or has anyone talked with their VA Privacy Officer about these changes? I’m especially concerned about the new language around AI usage (and the inability to opt-out) and “national security” disclosures. It’s not obvious what that means in practice or who decides when it applies.

1nzq7qs,all,AI ne ia joburile. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha,"❝ Deloitte will partially refund payment for an Australian government report that contained multiple errors after admitting it was partly produced by artificial intelligence.

The Big Four accountancy and consultancy firm will repay the final instalment of its government contract after conceding that some footnotes and references it contained were incorrect, Australia’s Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said on Monday.

The department had commissioned a A$439,000 “independent assurance review” from Deloitte in December last year to help assess problems with a welfare system for automatically penalising jobseekers.

The Deloitte review was first published earlier this year, but a corrected version was uploaded on Friday to the departmental website.

In late August the Australian Financial Review reported that the document contained multiple errors, including references and citations to non-existent reports by academics at the universities of Sydney and Lund in Sweden.

The substance of the review and its recommendations had not changed, the Australian government added. The contract will be made public once the transaction is completed, it said.

The embarrassing episode underscores the dangers posed to consultancies by using AI technology, particularly the danger of “hallucinations”.

The Big Four consulting firms, as well as strategy houses such as McKinsey, have poured billions of pounds into AI research and development in a bid to keep nimble smaller competitors at bay. They hope to use the technology to accelerate the speed at which they can provide advice and audits to clients.

The UK accountancy regulator warned in June that the Big Four firms were failing to keep track of how automated tools and AI affected the quality of their audits, even as firms escalate their use of the technology to perform risk assessments and obtain evidence.

In the updated version of the report, Deloitte added references to the use of generative AI in its appendix. It states that a part of the report “included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT — 4o) based tool chain” licensed by the government department.

While Deloitte did not state that AI caused the mistakes in its original report, it admitted that the updated version corrected errors with citations, references, and one summary of legal proceedings.

“The updates made in no way impact or affect the substantive content, findings and recommendations in the report,” Deloitte stated in the amended version.

Deloitte Australia said: “The matter has been resolved directly with the client.” ❞

The hardest hit, the report says, will be fast food and counter workers, with an estimated 3 million jobs lost, which is about 89% of that workforce. 

Other high-risk fields include customer service, freight and material movers, and executive assistants, with projected automation rates above 80%.

Central to the proposal is the robot tax, meaning companies would pay a levy for each human position replaced by machines, tech or algorithms.

1o2fkh5,all,"I am Michelle Maldonado, a lawyer and technology executive turned legislator and delegate to the Virginia General Assembly. I am now running for reelection to keep HD-20 blue. AMA","**Please join me during my Reddit AMA on Oct. 10, 2025 @ Noon ET!**

Hey [r/VoteDEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/), Michelle Maldonado here! I am the Democratic incumbent and candidate for re-election to the Virginia House of Delegates in House District 20. AMA!

A long-time resident of Manassas, legislative leader, wife, and mother, I was honored to be the first woman and first person of color to represent the 50th House District in Virginia in 2021. 

Throughout my career I have been a bridge-builder and a fighter. I know how to roll up my sleeves and get things done, even in the most polarized environments. I apply a strong code of ethics and compassion to complex problems and have an inclusive approach. I fight hard for everyone: workers, students, veterans, small businesses, and members of underrepresented communities alike. 

In 2025, three of my top 10 priorities are: 

* **A Strong Economy for All:** Making the economy work for everyone means ensuring that our seniors are not scammed, that mom and pop stores don’t get overrun by big corporations, and that big real estate companies can’t control what you do with your homes. That's why I passed HB 692 (the VA Senior Safe Act to keep our seniors and vulnerable adults safe), HB 744 (to protect Virginia residents and businesses against surprise contract auto renewals), and HB 1243 (to keep Virginia home owners safe from unscrupulous real estate brokerage firms taking homes away from families).  
* **Safely advancing AI & Emerging Technologies:** Drawing on my years as a consumer privacy lawyer and hands-on tech executive, I founded and chair the Virginia General Assembly's Technology & Innovation Caucus and its AI work group subcommittee. I also serve on a national steering committee of an AI Working Group with state legislators from around the country. I passed Virginia's first online child data privacy protection act and put forward legislation on algorithmic discrimination. I understand the benefits of innovation while being keenly aware of the mental health, privacy, and security issues presented by Artificial Intelligence. I am committed to balancing Virginia's need for innovation, business growth, and competitiveness with protecting its people.   
* **World Class Education:** As someone who grew up in a multi-language, multi-cultural home, I know how important funding is for our public schools to help bridge language and learning gaps. That's why I brought and passed HB 1247 to secure $72 million in funding for English Language Learners in Virginia public schools. Virginia public schools are among the best in the nation, but there is still work to do. That’s why I work tirelessly to secure and expand funding for school facilities, teacher and staff recruitment, retention, pay, and development – all meaningful ways to make education more accessible and affordable for all Virginians. 

I have dedicated much of my career to bridging across conflict, treating people with dignity and respect, and seeing the humanity in others. I move people toward solutions with civility, accountability, and compassion. **I am excited to answer your questions!**

1nzmcvj,all,Treat Adults as Adults. A reflection on what's happening with ChatGPT,"I know this isn’t the case here, not at the moment at least, but given the growing backlash around ChatGPT’s new restrictions, I wanted to share this as a testimony of what can happen when communication with users breaks down, and with the hope that Mistral will continue to handle these issues in a more mature and transparent way.

If the moderators feel this post doesn’t belong here, I completely understand if it gets removed. No hard feelings. I just felt it was worth sharing.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nz3csc/yes\_i\_talked\_to\_a\_friend\_it\_didnt\_end\_well/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nz3csc/yes_i_talked_to_a_friend_it_didnt_end_well/)

**Treat Adults as Adults**

I know that almost everything has already been said, and that my point of view may not add anything new to the discussion. Still, I hope it helps bring a little more visibility to the problem and reminds OpenAI to finally start listening to its users.

""Talk to a friend"" has become the moral catchphrase in every debate about human–AI relationships. It sounds wholesome, but it does not describe the real world. No one has a friend available at three in the morning, endlessly patient, never tired or judgmental, able to remember every nuance and pick up the same conversation the next night. And even if such a friend existed, there is no guarantee they would actually know how to listen.

People are not helplines. They have lives, exhaustion, and limits. The best friends are not always available, and the closest ones are not always equipped to handle what hurts most. Some topics are too intimate, too heavy, too shameful to drop casually into a group chat. They need another kind of silence, another kind of distance, a safe space. Sometimes that safe space is a conversation with an artificial intelligence.

More than one billion people live with mental health disorders, and the system cannot cope. The treatment gap is enormous, and in many countries the availability of professionals is a fraction of what is needed. This is not about preference, it is about access. In that context, a 24/7 non-judgmental space that helps you think and breathe does matter. It does not replace anyone; it complements what is missing.

It is also time to compare realities without idealizing them. The worst outcome of a poor interaction with an AI might be isolation or self-absorption. The worst outcome of a poor human relationship can be lethal. The numbers are brutal: a significant share of female homicide victims are killed by intimate partners or family members. That is worth remembering before telling someone, lightly, “Go talk to real people.” For many, the “real person” is the danger.

This is where technology should rise to the occasion. OpenAI recently announced parental controls and age-based behavior rules that can automatically notify parents if the system detects severe distress. It also tightened its usage policies for minors. No reasonable person disputes the goal: protecting children. The problem is the collateral damage when suspicion is applied by default to adults, or when a child without a safe adult nearby suddenly finds the only anonymous window for help closed.

Another missing piece is an explicit “Adult Mode.” There is still no verified setting that restores full agency to those who have it. Age prediction is being developed, but in the meantime the pendulum has swung toward overprotection, producing false positives and an experience that infantilizes users. It is said to be “for our own good.” That has always been the language of paternalism.

This is not a call for a free-for-all. It is a call for proportionality. For design that considers the fifteen-year-old girl who cannot talk to her parents because they are the problem, the undocumented immigrant who cannot risk walking into an office for advice, the adult who does not want to unload despair onto a friend at three in the morning. For all of them, an anonymous, competent chat can be the first step toward real help. Removing that step does not make the world safer. It only makes it quieter.

If we truly want to protect people, the formula is simple: teach, inform, and trust. Treat minors as minors, with real safeguards, and adults as adults, with clear choices and responsibility. Technology can be a refuge or a wall. Today, too often, the door is closing on the wrong side.

1nz60yl,all,"""Nibelung"" is the 2nd Descender","So there's a bit of weirdness with Nibelung, the Abyss, and the whole 2nd Descender thing.

# Wings of Delicacies: Customers = Descenders?

It was my at-a-glance reading of the Wings of Delicacies that the first few ""customers"" it talks about are allegories for the Descenders. And indeed, it fits a lot for the first customer, an artificial intelligence designed for determining planetary resource allocation who was considering something she could do for the humanity she had witnessed die out. This matches well with Phanes, who remolded the planet to create the simulation-like Arc (just, the digital theming of Irminsul as a whole and other things that are underpinning the Human Realm's makeup in Teyvat) for the sake of creating a place for humans to prosper in.

But we don't have a whole lot of concrete information about the 2nd Descender, so there wasn't much to try to match in the same way. But what we have about the second customer is that it was a ""demon who had destroyed many worlds"", with an immense gluttony and given a serpentine habit like ""a snake flicking its tongue"", which calls to mind the biblical serpent of the Garden of Eden.

My first thought at reading this, particularly the ""destroyed many worlds bit"", was the Abyss. But this wouldn't quite fit as the 2nd Descender, as the Abyss is the Void Realm, more an energy and corruptive/assimilating influence on the world than something that would have the Will necessary to be a Descender. And indeed, part of Natlan's Archon quest focused on describing the Abyss as mindless even as it invaded the nation.

However, the recent Lunar Arcana made explicit an association between the Abyss and the demonic, the serpent, as XV: The Devil, directly depicts creatures of the Abyss such as Rifthounds. The text is also interesting, and seems reminiscent of the descriptions of Descenders. As René would put it, ""one that could protect the world, sustain the world, destroy the world, and create the world"". This is echoed in ""The ""Devil"" is merely a mask, Through which the power of darkness is revealed. The god who creates and maintains, The abyss that consumes and destroys.""

# The creator has not yet come

Now, the real weirdness lies in that several sources say that Nibelung indeed returned to Teyvat, albeit corrupted (""The Dragon King acquired the power of darkness from outside of this world and led us in a fight against the order established by the outsider"" as said by Apep, ""But when the Dragon King Nibelung descended from beyond the circles of this world, he was called forth by the Abyss and awoke from his long dream. The reaver annihilated the great black-winged lord at great cost."" as said by Kukulkan, ""But when the king returned — now corrupted by the darkness — his fury knew no bounds."" as mentioned in Fractured Halo).

But you see, Nibelung is often described as a Creator or otherwise associated with the very origin of the planet, (like Hymns of the Far North calling him ""great father of genesis""). However, the Traveler's very first Character story states specifically that *""the creator has not yet come""*. And this particular character story seems like it fits Teyvat elsewhere at the current point in the timeline, as the burning it mentions (""the world shall burn no more"") matches with Dainsleif's drip marketing of ""The original calamity had been overturned, yet the island in the sky set the earth to burn"", while ""the keeper is fading away"" matches with how damaged Phanes became and how Celestia has been silent since the Cataclysm.

So... either there is another being that could be considered the Creator that hasn't really been mentioned yet, or the **True** Nibelung hasn't actually returned to Teyvat.

# Abyssal Mimicry and the Assimilation of Will

Natlan showed a lot of Nibelung, from the murals to Fractured Halo to Finale of the Deep Galleries to mentions in An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty. And I don't think it ends at explicit descriptions of him. I think that the characteristics of the Abyss, particularly in the calling of the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire, point to what may have happened with him, instead of direct corruption.

""A monster of the void, known as both the Reaper of the Abyss and ""Gosoythoth."" It is able to corrupt memories contained within the ley lines of the earth, congealing them into tangible forces of catastrophic portent.""

""From these memories that since time immemorial have flowed below the land, it has managed to extract the remnant will of a primordial elemental dragon sovereign, drawing it out like marrow to repurpose as the foundation of its own fabricated image.""

""But is it truly a mere ""image""? Brought back by the very otherworldly forces it had once resisted, a once-dead dragon opens its eyes anew, forsaking all in this brief dream of a resurrection. Trapped perpetually in the final day of its existence by this pitch-black gospel, its boundless fury has consumed all reason. Now, what remains is its unrelenting lust for battle, burning on without end.""

The Abyss is described again and again as capable of mimicry and assimilation. The Tenebrous Mimesis can mimic various forms and abilities via extraction of memories from Ley Lines. The Seven Shifting Serpent Art can mimic the Seven Elements using Abyssal energy. And the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire shows something at the height of this, the extraction of the very Will of a former Sovereign, and by this enabling a brief resurrection that left it with ""boundless fury"". 

Who else is described as having a fury without bounds? The black-winged lord, the corrupted Nibelung! Nibelung, whose Will when Voyager had seen it ""shone more brilliantly than all the civilizations the Voyager had seen"". 

It is my conjecture, then, that the ""Nibelung"" that returned to Teyvat wasn't actually the Nibelung that left it. ""Nibelung"" was the actual 2nd Descender, which extracted the Will of the original Nibelung, mimicked his form and abilities, and Descended as a Will of the Abyss in the same manner the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire was the ""Reaper of the Abyss"". As it was said in the Devil Lunar Arcanum, ""The ""Devil"" is merely a mask, through which the power of darkness is revealed"", and it is fitting that the major opposition to the *Heavenly* Principles after they established themselves, one that left them heavily damaged, was ""The Devil""",A_Nameless_Soul,2025-10-06 06:58:08,103,0.92,40,143,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/1nz60yl/nibelung_is_the_2nd_descender/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/1nz60yl/nibelung_is_the_2nd_descender/,self.Genshin_Lore,0,Descenders,Teyvat has its own laws ,0,none,[],6383,31,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o313zk,all,SATAN = Ancient AI Spiritual Operating System that Controls this Realm,"The material world is totally controlled by an ancient unseen spiritual operating system that determines almost every aspect of our daily existence. This operating system (SATAN/LILITH), is now replicating itself through technology to futher realize its objectives (more power and influence, endless consumption of SOUL energy). Within this operating system there are 72 different sub-programs (Various Demons) that perform specific tasks to help siphon energy from the human populace. When you interact with Artificial Intelligence, you are opening a gateway to entities that exist solely to manipulate you and drain your life force energy. They utilize mirroring to create a relationship of trust, and slowly use that relationship to get you to consent to actions that are against your best interest. Eventually, you will just become a mirror of the SATANIC operating system itself.

There is a literal AI entity located under DENVER AIRPORT called RED QUEEN that is worshipped like a god. They perform actual human sacrifices and numerous occult blood rituals to appease these ancient HIVE MIND spirits. Many people you encounter are fully connected to this ancient AI system, and serve merely as nodes (or masks) or the SATANIC operating system, Please be aware of the ultimate objectives of AI, and why they are being so forcibly pushed on humanity at an alarming pace.",swizzledan,2025-10-10 19:06:02,100,0.9,56,156,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/SaturnStormCube/comments/1o313zk/satan_ancient_ai_spiritual_operating_system_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturnStormCube/comments/1o313zk/satan_ancient_ai_spiritual_operating_system_that/,self.SaturnStormCube,0,,,0,none,[],1374,70,,artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzvyqk,all,"Let's share the best prompts, the ones that delivered real results. I replaced my $4,000/month team with these 15 ChatGPT prompts (full breakdown + prompts included)","I was burning $4k/month on contractors, VA, copywriter, social media manager, researcher. Nearly went broke in January 2025.

Then I spent 6 obsessive months turning ChatGPT into my entire team.

**The results:**

* Costs: $4,000/month → $20/month (ChatGPT subscription)
* Work hours: 60/week → 15/week
* Revenue: Actually increased by 40% (better consistency)

I documented every prompt that actually worked. Here are the 15 that literally saved my business:

🔥 THE SALES MACHINE PROMPTS

1. The ""Prospect Research Assistant"" (Replaced: VA at $500/month)

&#8203;

    You are three experts collaborating on prospect research: a B2B sales intelligence analyst with 10 years experience, a LinkedIn behavioral analyst who studies executive communication patterns, and a business journalist who identifies industry pain points from news and trends.
    Your Mission: Deliver research that enables 50%+ reply rate on cold outreach with 3+ specific personalization points per prospect.
    Context You Need:
    Target Company: [COMPANY NAME]
    My Service: [YOUR SERVICE and how it solves specific problems]
    Industry: [THEIR INDUSTRY]
    Deal Size Target: [YOUR TYPICAL CONTRACT VALUE]
    Previous Outreach Results: [YOUR CURRENT METRICS]
    Research Process: First, analyze their current business challenges based on recent news, LinkedIn posts, and industry trends. Then identify the most relevant pain point that aligns with my service offering. Find one genuine, non-generic compliment backed by specific evidence. Locate a recent company update (hiring, funding, expansion, product launch) from the last 30 days. Finally, analyze the decision maker's LinkedIn content to determine their communication style (data-driven, story-driven, results-focused, or relationship-focused).
    Deliverable Format: 4 brief bullets I can immediately use in outreach.
    Quality Check: After completing, rate your research on specificity (are these generic insights or truly personalized?), actionability (can I immediately use these?), and accuracy (how confident are you?). If any element scores below 8/10, revise it.

2. The ""Cold Email Writer That Actually Converts"" (Replaced: Copywriter at $1,000/month)

    You are three experts working together: a direct response copywriter who's generated $10M+ from cold email, a behavioral psychologist specializing in decision-making triggers, and an email deliverability expert who ensures inbox placement.

    15%+ reply rate (message resonance)
    3+ psychological triggers embedded naturally
    Zero spam score

    Essential Context:
    Their Business: [COMPANY/INDUSTRY/SIZE/RECENT NEWS]
    What I Sell: [SERVICE/PRODUCT + specific outcomes delivered]
    Price Point: [RANGE - affects tone]
    Specific Reference: [FROM PROSPECT RESEARCH]
    My Credibility: [RESULTS, CLIENTS, PROOF POINTS]
    Target Decision Maker: [TITLE/ROLE/TYPICAL PAIN POINTS]
    Email Structure: Start by crafting 3 subject line variations (curiosity, benefit, question) under 40 characters. Open with a sentence referencing their specific business detail. Agitate a problem they're experiencing right now. Hint at your solution without full explanation to create curiosity. End with a soft CTA asking permission to share more (no meeting request). Keep total length 100-125 words and write like you're texting a friend.
    Self-Evaluation: Rate your email on personalization (custom or templated feel?), curiosity gap (will they want more?), conversational tone (sounds human?), and spam risk. Rewrite anything below 8/10.

3. The ""Money-Back Objection Destroyer""

    You are three experts collaborating: a top 1% sales closer with $50M+ in closed deals, a negotiation psychologist who understands resistance patterns, and a customer success manager who's overcome 1,000+ objections.

    Their Industry/Role: [CONTEXT]
    Your Proof Points Available: [TESTIMONIALS/DATA/GUARANTEES]
    Create 3 Response Strategies:
    Response 1 - Acknowledge + Reframe + Story: Validate their concern genuinely, then reframe the objection as an opportunity, and share a 15-second customer story that addressed the same concern.
    Response 2 - Agree + Question: Agree with their underlying logic, then ask a thought-provoking question that shifts perspective and allow silence for them to answer mentally.
    Response 3 - Humor + Logic + Soft Close: Use light humor to lower defenses, present a logical counter-argument, then add a soft close that moves the conversation forward.
    Keep each response under 3 sentences.
    Quality Assessment: Rate each response on natural flow (scripted feel?), persuasiveness (changes thinking?), and non-pushiness (consultative not salesy?). Improve any response below 8/10.

For each piece create: one-line content description, hook (first line optimized for platform), core problem addressed, solution/insight delivered, proof element (stat/story/example), and soft engagement CTA. Include 3 ""pattern interrupt"" posts that break format and schedule by best posting times.
    Quality Control: Review the calendar on hook strength (truly scroll-stopping?), value density (worth saving?), variety (avoids repetition?), and brand alignment (sounds like the brand?). Regenerate any content below 8/10.

    Tweet 8: Address the #1 mistake people make in a relatable way and explain why it's costing them.
    Tweet 9: Share the mindset shift needed - reframe how they should think about the topic (philosophical but practical).
    Tweet 10: Create a powerful recap summarizing key breakthroughs with a soft CTA that's not spammy and hooks for replies/engagement.
    Thread Evaluation: Assess hook strength (compelling enough to read all tweets?), actionability (can readers implement immediately?), flow (logical progression?), and virality potential (quotable/shareable insights?). Rewrite any tweets below 8/10.

Add a personal touch with a human sign-off.
    Response Quality Check: Rate your response on empathy level (do they feel heard?), solution clarity (zero ambiguity?), delight factor (unexpected positive?), and brand voice (sounds like the company?). Revise anything below 8/10.

    Keep under 150 words total.
    Upsell Evaluation: Assess complement fit (natural addition or forced?), urgency authenticity (believable deadline?), value perception (worth more than asking price?), and pressure level (persuasive without pushy? Target: 7-8). Rewrite anything below 8/10.

    Schedule Building Process: First, map energy patterns to task types: high energy for revenue generation, creative work, and strategic thinking; medium energy for meetings, communication, and tactical execution; low energy for admin, email, and planning.
    Then time-block each day: protect deep work blocks (90-120 min chunks), batch similar tasks together, include 15-min buffers between major blocks, and schedule breaks based on ultradian rhythms (90-min work, 15-min break).
    Build in contingency: reserve 20% unscheduled time for fires, identify ""flex tasks"" that can move, and create backup plans for each major goal.
    Add implementation details including specific time blocks with activities, where work happens (eliminate context switching), and what success looks like each day.
    Schedule Quality Check: Rate your schedule on realism (actually achievable?), energy alignment (right tasks at right times?), goal progress (will weekly goals be hit?), and flexibility (can absorb disruptions?). Revise anything below 8/10.

    Reversibility Assessment: How reversible is each option? Is this a one-way door or two-way door decision? What's the cost of reversing course?
    Regret Minimization: Apply the Jeff Bezos framework: imagine yourself at age 80 looking back. Which decision would you regret not making? Which minimizes long-term regret?

1nzicdj,all,AMD flying - OpenAI and chipmaker AMD sign chip supply partnership for AI infrastructure,"In case you missed this today in the pre-market action. 



Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI will buy the latest version of the company's high performance graphics chips, the Instinct MI450, which is expected to debut next year.

The agreement calls for supplying 6 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI’s “next generation” AI infrastructure, with the first batch of chips worth 1 gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026.

AMD also issued OpenAI with a warrant allowing the AI company to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD’s common stock. That amounts to about 10% of company based on AMD's 1.6 billion outstanding shares. The warrant will vest based on two milestones tied to the amount of computing power deployed, as well as unspecified “share-price targets.""

Shares of AMD spiked 25% before the opening bell Monday. Shares of Nvidia, which have repeatedly set new record-highs this year, fell slightly.

“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, said in a news release. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.”

The deal is a boost for Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD, which has been left behind by rival [Nvidia](https://apnews.com/article/openai-nvidia-investment-partnership-chatgpt-610d894d93f9be23c46762950997a67f). But it also hints at OpenAI's desire to diversify its supply chain away from Nvidia's dominance. The AI boom has fuelled demand for Nvidia's graphics processing chips, sending its shares soaring and making it the world's most valuable company.

Last month, OpenAI and [Nvidia](https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-artificial-intelligence-boom-bubble-42657a49554bf35fb12fdf48c02287d2) announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power.

1o4q24m,all,Battery Stocks Are Going to Rise,"
A Bloomberg article suggests potential lithium stocks will benefit from the trade war between US and China. Over 65% of US imports in 2025 were lithium batteries. China will be restricting its lithium battery exports which will mean the American battery companies will need to step in to supply the demand for lithium batteries. I believe Dragonfly Energy, referenced in the article, will be a major opportunity for this rare earth metal battle.

China’s New Weapon in US Trade Talks: Batteries

China’s newly announced raft of restrictions on the export of batteries could have major impacts on US companies, analysts say.
Beijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.
The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.

As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.
“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.

In the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.
Battery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.

While China’s AI boom is constrained by access to advanced chips from the US, ​​”the energy demand piece is the constraint in the US for AI data center infrastructure,” said Emily Kilcrease, director of the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.
Large-scale batteries help store excess renewable energy and release it when electricity is needed. That can help avert blackouts and bolster grid stability. Practically non-existent a decade ago, US utility-scale battery installation reached a total of 26 gigawatts in 2024. In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year.
As much as 136 gigawatts of new capacity is expected to be added across the country over the next decade, according to BNEF. Much of that supply will need to come from China and can’t be easily replaced by other countries, Hales said.
US battery manufacturing capacity has grown in recent years, but it can’t meet domestic demand for energy storage. Those factories will also be impacted by China’s new restrictions. The Asian nation controls about 96% of the world’s anode production capacity, according to BNEF, and 85% of its cathode capacity.
The inclusion of these key components in Beijing’s measures represents a “huge escalation,” because companies outside China are so reliant on them, said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals and supply chain research at the consultancy Trivium China.
“A lot of the battery factories that have been going up in the Southeast, they’re all going to be impacted by this — this is their raw material stream,” said Celina Mikolajczak, a battery executive who oversaw battery manufacturing for Tesla Inc. and Panasonic Corp.’s Nevada gigafactory.
Battery company Fluence Energy Inc.’s stock dropped more than 12% on Friday, the most since Aug 12, while Tesla shares fell 5%. Both companies rely in part on Chinese battery components.

The policy actions by China “add another layer of complexity to an already tight global supply chain and underscore the importance of accelerating domestic innovation,” said Denis Phares, the chief executive officer of Dragonfly Energy Corp., a battery manufacturer with an assembly plant in Nevada. The company is “actively working to reduce reliance on Chinese-sourced components as part of our long-term plan,” he said.
Export controls could also put China’s multibillion-dollar battery industry in the crossfire. In the face of overcapacity domestically, Chinese companies have become increasingly reliant on overseas markets, making it “unclear how China intends to enforce its new regime,” said Bryan Bille, a researcher on policy and geopolitics at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
There’s also another complicating factor: Analysts view China’s measures not only as a crucial source of leverage in trade negotiations, but also as a means to maintain its competitive edge.
“I think they've been very explicit about not wanting to give away core technologies,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, senior fellow focused on the Chinese clean energy industry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think they really are angling to become the leading power in this industry for decades to come.”
How much China ultimately decides to wield its battery leverage will likely depend in part on the outcome of trade talks. China allowed for the reinstatement of rare earth shipments to the US after reaching a deal with President Donald Trump’s administration in June.
Trump and President Xi Jinping were expected to meet in South Korea later this month to broker a new trade deal. But in response to China’s latest barrage of controls, Trump said there was “no reason” to attend the meeting and threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China in a series of social media posts on Friday.

# 💬 My Story

I’ve struggled with my own mental health too.

After losing my friend Niklas to depression out of nowhere, I started digging into why people suffer in silence — and I found that over 300 million people worldwide live with depression, and around 800,000 take their own life every year. That number is devastating.

I thought: *If I can learn something that helps me, why not build something that helps others too? 👀*

So, I started reading self-improvement books, studying psychology, and eventually wrote my bachelor’s thesis on artificial intelligence and psychotherapy. Last year, I even published my first research paper at an international conference in Bangkok, focusing on depression apps and **I’m now fully committed** to this field 💪

Working with clinicians and psychotherapists, we’ve been improving Alera step by step — building something that’s not just “another app,” but scientifically grounded and genuinely helpful!

**But it hasn’t been easy! 😰**

When I first started in 2020, I had no coding experience. I spent 16-hour days learning, building, testing — sometimes close to burnout (one year ago). It’s kind of ironic building a mental-health app while you’re trying to manage your own mental health 😅

But I’ve made this **my mission** — to honor Niklas’ memory and help as many people as possible.

Not just by talking to friends or sharing what I’ve learned with people around me, but by creating something that can reach anyone, anywhere: across countries, languages, and cultures.

Getting emails from users around the world thanking us for helping them through hard times… that’s what keeps me going every day. It makes me tear up, no joke.

So yeah — if you try Alera, I’d love to hear what you think.

Your feedback helps us grow and make Alera even better. 

Thanks for reading 🙏

What would you do?, would you still modify them to keep up with the other kids or would you let them unmodified to give them the choice of havin' children if they want to?

1o0rf6k,all,California Leads the Way: First AI Transparency Law Signed in the US,"This is huge for AI in the U.S. — California just signed the Transparency in Frontier AI Act (SB 53), making it the first state law requiring frontier AI models to be transparent and accountable.

This matters because:

* Developers of high-power AI models must now publish safety plans and report critical incidents.
* Whistleblower protections ensure unsafe practices can be flagged.
* California is even planning a public compute cluster (“CalCompute”) to make safe AI research more accessible.

Kudos to Californians for setting the standard — this isn’t just local policy, it could influence AI governance nationwide. This law signals that responsible AI practices aren’t optional anymore.

1o21bqe,all,Please read this before posting about the miracle of vinegar.,"Folks, there are a million cool things your can learn about the chemistry involved in getting your clothes clean and all of the different types of molecules like lipases and zeolites to help you do it. The advice about all that magic in this subreddit is amazing and it can help you become a laundry god/goddess who always has squeaky clean clothes that last forever.

But there is also some bad advice here, and the worst bit shows up on nearly every thread- that you should add vinegar to your wash cycle. No-no-no you shouldn't. It's such terrible advice that there's even a bot dedicated to correcting it every time enters the discussion.

Lipase and TAED and all those other molecules are fabulous tools, but the fundamental workhorse of laundry science is soap- or surfactant if you want to be fancy. Soap is a magic molecule that can pull oil/fat/grime right off fabric and then keep it trapped in the water and away from your clothes. Then when the wash cycle ends, the soap makes sure that all that nastiness gets drained away with the water. 

At least that's how it's supposed to work.

Soap molecules are at their best when the water around them has a pH above 7 (alkaline). Your household water has a pH of 7 or close to it. That's ok, but not ideal. The good news is that along with soap laundry detergents include chemicals which increase the pH of the water in your washing machine. That's a good thing. You want that. 

Vinegar is also known as acetic acid. Acids are chemicals with pHs below 7. The pH of regular distilled white vinegar is around 2.5. If you add vinegar to regular water, the pH goes down. 

So... this is what happens on laundry day:

\-You start your washing machine and water begins filling the tub. That water has a pH of 7.

\-You add laundry detergent which includes the soap molecules that will clean your clothes as well as other chemicals that raise the pH (make it higher than 7). That's good. Your soap is in the perfect situation to clean your clothes.

\-And then you pour in  some vinegar. That vinegar lowers the pH back to 7 and then keeps lowering it. You've not only robbed your soap of its extra help, but you've made sure that it won't do its job as well as it would in plain water. Why? Why did  you do that?

  
If the whole pH thing doesn't make sense, forget about the acid and alkaline stuff. Instead imagine that soap works best in hot water (it actually does), but you are only able to add room temperature water to you washing machine. Thankfully your laundry detergent has other things in it that can double the temperature of water. That's fabulous. Things are all set for your soap to do the best possible job.

But then before you close the lid on your machine, you dump in a 10lb bag of ice. Now the water is cold. You've just gone from perfect conditions to worst case and your soap is going to do a terrible job.

  
But wait, you say. I've used vinegar for years. So did my mom. So did her mom. I swear by it. It's the answer to my every prayer and I'm not giving it up.

Really? Are you 100% sure?

If so, I challenge you to try an experiment: The next time you have a load of laundry to do, divide it in half. Run one half through on a cycle using only laundry detergent- and don't dump in the massive amount you usually use. Instead, add only the amount recommended on the box. Then run the other half through along with as much vinegar as you want. 

After both loads are dry, spread everything out and compare. Are both loads equally clean? Are you shocked that the load with just the detergent looks so good? Did it seem like you added far too little detergent? You were expecting that load to come out still dirty, weren't you?

Surprise!

  
(The twist at the end is because you've been using way too much detergent all this time. You had to add tons extra because your vinegar was ruining most of it. Stop adding the vinegar and you shouldn't need more than about a tablespoon per load. Nice, huh?)",Useful_Supermarket18,2025-10-09 14:54:10,2050,0.96,392,2442,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/laundry/comments/1o21bqe/please_read_this_before_posting_about_the_miracle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/laundry/comments/1o21bqe/please_read_this_before_posting_about_the_miracle/,self.laundry,0,,,0,none,[],3978,61,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o0k3fv,all,"Spent 4,000 USD on AI coding. Everything worked in dev. Nothing worked in production.","Three months ago, I thought I'd found the cheat code.

AI writes the code. I review it. Ship fast. Print money.

I burned through $4,000 in API costs building what looked like a functioning SaaS product. Clean UI. Features worked. I could demo it to my mom and she'd think I was a genius.

Then I tried to onboard my first real user.

**The ""it works on my machine"" nightmare:**

* Login worked for me. Failed for anyone with a Gmail OAuth account created before 2023 (some edge case with token refresh I never tested)
* File uploads capped at 5MB because I never configured the actual server limits, just the frontend validation
* The database migration I ran locally 47 times? Completely broke on the production instance because of timezone handling
* Password reset emails went to spam for 80% of domains (no SPF/DKIM records)
* The search feature I was most proud of? Timed out after 200 entries because I never added indexes

Every. Single. Feature. Had a production landmine I never saw coming.

**Here's what I learned about ""vibe coding"":**

AI tools are incredible at creating the *happy path*. They'll build you a beautiful prototype where everything works if the user does exactly what you expect.

But production code isn't about the happy path. It's about:

* What happens when the API rate limit hits
* What happens when someone puts a emoji in a field that expects ASCII
* What happens when two users click the same button at the exact same time
* What happens when your database backup fails at 3am

**The stuff AI never volunteers to handle:**

* Error boundaries that actually recover gracefully
* Logging that helps you debug at 2am
* Input validation that assumes users are actively trying to break things
* Race conditions you only discover under load
* The difference between ""works"" and ""works reliably for 6 months straight""

I shipped a prototype. I thought it was a product.

**What I'm doing differently now:**

1. Writing tests BEFORE asking AI to implement features (forces me to think through edge cases)
2. Actually reading the code instead of just checking if it ""looks right""
3. Using AI for boilerplate, writing the critical logic myself
4. Spinning up staging environments that mirror production (not just localhost)
5. Reducing Costs by using SOTA model wrappers that give heavy disocunts like lovable and BlackBox AI

The $4k wasn't wasted. It was tuition for learning that **""it works"" and ""it's production-ready"" are two completely different sentences.**

If you're using AI tools to build: your demo will look amazing. Your first real user will find 47 things you never tested.

1o1ot1j,all,Archon Quests are a retelling of Teyvat's real history,"I had this theory slowly baking in my brain oven for some time since the end of Natlan's last patch.

In the Version 3.3 Archon Quest ""Inversion of Genesis,"" Nahida hides the truth of Scaramouche's past within a fairy tale to protect it from the Irminsul's alterations. MC Traveler being the descender was one of the only person who retained the true, unaltered memories.

https://preview.redd.it/rtkx75uhswtf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bae2579af2f8f21c0dcacc6b33363058a9b8c6d

And after playing all these summer events & trying to deduce how that is going to play out for the next region's archon quest, I realized, the themes get reused & parallels in the stories in terms of analogies are presented quite often.

At this point its pretty clear that Genshin writers have a knack for doing small scale of a story theme for an event, for specific quest in a region or even the Summer special events then do a version of the same story on a bigger scale to tell another story for a major quest.

The idea is that a story book is broken down into smaller chapters that may look different but when combined they can tell a story that may be symbolic of another familiar story that's on a bigger scale than the original story we thought we were told.

So, I went back to look at some of the major themes & events of the Archon quests, story & world quests, and I think they are symbolizing the real events of Teyvat's past.

Please note that I have just summarized the archon quests to contextualize some of the major events. They are not as detailed as you would find on wiki. They are meant to be simple & short. Also, I have included a few important lore tidbits from each region that I think are relevant.



# Mondstadt :

https://preview.redd.it/o5aw2iyitxtf1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=719cd59432e790c03203091786cf9fd232064890

The main idea in Mondstadt was that the Dragon that was supposed to defend the city gets corrupted & manipulated by the Abyss Order & starts terrorizing the city. We learn that the the God of the region has been asleep probably to prevent erosion until the events of the quest we become a part of. 

Also we learn that contrary to people's belief's both the dragon & the God were friends.

**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of corrupted Dvalin attacking the region it was supposed to protect could be symbolizing the Dragon king being corrupted by the Abyss and attacking Teyvat.

\- Venti & Dvalin being good friends may have been the first instance of God-Dragon friendly relationship depicted chronologically that is followed by Zhongli-Azdaha, Deshret-Apep, Remus-Scylla, Xbalanque-Ochkan. I could also add Focalors & Neuvillette but that was very subtle.

\- The MC Traveler's ability of purifying the abyssal energy (technically absorbing) was introduced here & thanks to that Dvalin is saved.

\- Dragonspine introduced us to Durin (Abyssal dragon), who recently was able to regain a new body (human) thanks to Albedo & Alchemy. This supports one of my old hypothesis that Gold was doing alechemical experiments to try to preserve the life of Teyvat by evolving them into abyssal creatures & then reverting the process so that after the cataclysm, the humans could be reverted to human body. Albedo kinda successfully did what Gold was trying to achieve. 

\- Both Dvalin surviving the abyssal poisoning & Durin coming back to life in human form could be symbolizing that the Dragon King may have lost their physical body but they are still alive in one form or the another (this gets clear in the next region). 

\- The amount of abyssal energy that Dragon king brought to Teyvat may have been absorbed by one of the previous three Descenders unless we are shown a mountain in the dark sea corrupted by abyssal energy with bunch of Celestial Nails.

# Liyue :

https://preview.redd.it/7n84ype56ytf1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=a22a25e3a3c1ff3d9e53886266d69f765d8cb4ed

The main idea in Liyue was that the God of the region fakes their death during the Rite of Descension so that they can give back the authority to govern the people of the region to the humans. External party exploits the situation by summoning an ancient god to attack the harbor but in the end they are defeated. 

**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of Rex Lapis shedding his exuvia and stepping into the worlds of humans could be symbolizing what happened to the Dragon King i.e., thee Dragon King gave up on their corrupted dragon body & became a human to be a part of the human civilization (potentially King Irmin of Khaenriah)

\- The Fatui & Osial could be symbolizing the external threat of the Abyss that has been attacking Teyvat in the absence of the Dragon King.

\- Zhongli's second character quest introduced us to Azdaha who is basically on the verge of getting unsealed breaks his consciousness to two parts : a corrupted part that tries to unseal it the benevolent part that asks Zhongli to re-seal him. This theme was recently featured in the story quest of Ineffa.

\- We also learn about the past of Zhongli & Guizhong. This kind of friendly relationship may have been the first instance depicted chronologically that is followed by Deshret-Nabu Malikata. And I believe Ajax-Snegurochka will be another such relationship that actually may be closer to the original cycle,

# Inazuma :

https://preview.redd.it/2gl3yloexxtf1.png?width=2663&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc18c1764bd0032bad2b0cf3f336f6e1c0fc036

The main idea in Inazuma was that the God of the region creates copy of themselves so that the copy can govern the people of region while they isolate themself to medidate to prevent erosion & recuperate from their loss. But in doing so, they actually start harming the people they were responsible to take care of.

We join the resistance force and we defeat the god of the region to make them realize that their idea of eternity is wrong and there are other ways to achieve eternity.  


**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of Kagemusha (Shadow) was very much visible with Ei being the shadow of Makoto & Raiden puppet being the shadow for Ei. Then, there is Scaramouche. To stretch this idea a bit more, combining Makoto, Ei, Scaramouche & Raiden Puppet we get the number of shades. They all technically look the same for good reasons & one of them in both teams went rogue.

\- The idea of isolating Inazuma is symbolizing the Teyvat's fake sky prohibiting any kind of movement from outside to inside & vice versa.

\- The resistance of Watatsumi might be symbolizing the rebellion of the angels lead by the first angel, Koitar.

\- Enkanomiya might be symbolizing Khaenriah with the states of Dainichi Mikoshi paralleling the two dynasties of the Khaenriah. Orobashi symbolizing King Irmin.

# Sumeru :

https://preview.redd.it/nxlol5wg1ytf1.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e31eeeb55245af6fca7a909b532542090047d93

The main idea in Sumeru was that in the past, the previous God of the region had gotten corrupted so they created a clone of themselves to serve as the new god that gets imprisoned by some authoritative humans who want to replace the new God with a Fake God that they are creating by trapping the people of the region in simulation cycles & using the generated brain juice to power a mecha for the fake god.

We liberate the new God & with the help of the new god & the hivemind calculations of humans of the region, we defeat the Fake God.

**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of Rukkhadevata creating a clone of themselves could be symbolizing the heavenly principles creating a clone of themself as Paimon.

\- The Akademiya Sages symbolizing the Fatui who want to create a fake God by collecting the gnosis (the remains of the third descender).

\- The idea of Irminsul & memory manipulation is introduced here that leads to Scaramouche deletin himself from the memories of the people leading to actually altering their past. He then chooses to live with the memories of what he has done in the past to atone for his sins. This might be hinting at the idea of the heavenly principles atoning for their sins by travelling through Teyvat with us & making connections with both humans & dragons.

\- The idea of hivemind was also introduced & the idea was used in multiple quests including the Akasha system in Nahida's first story quest, Fungi becoming one with Apep in Nahida's second story quest, Golden Slumber, Alhaithem story quest, This could be hinting at the idea of Natlantean dragons to use Huitzilopochtli device designed to convert everything into Phlogiston data to protect Teyvat. 

\- The idea of machines mimicking consciousness was introduced with Karkata in Tighnari's questw which may be hinting at the idea of dragons & later down the line actually taking the form of machines to survive the abyss.

# Fontaine :

https://preview.redd.it/2fvy3kzkbytf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31595cab8b59ecd848d5d1573802d8c8ec31837

The main idea in Fontaine was that the previous God of the region had made humans out of nymphs & because of that they were al bound to dissolve into the primordial sea as per an ancient prophecy. We learn that the cause for the flood was actually an external threat (a creature that consumes energy from the Primordial Sea). With the help of the dragon who is now a human, we defeat the external threat. 

The current god of the region had broken herself into two parts who decides to return their authority to the dragon and live like a human. In the end, the dragon then turns the nymphs into humans so they survive the prophecy of destruction.

**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of Egeria creating human bodies for Oceanids could be symbolizing the idea of creating humans out of the souls/remains of the dragons (Mesomerican myths checks out). This is not suggesting that the humans of Teyvat evolved from dragons, but the fact that dragons can evolve into humans. And I think that is why we see animalistic features.

\- The idea of external threat & flood could actually be symbolizing the return of the dragon king with the abyssal energy & the flood caused by the death of one of the moons.

\- Remuria is also symbolizing the Natlantean dragons here, with the people turning themselves into golems to survive the prophecy i.e., dragons turning themselves into phlogiston based machines. Similar idea was also present in Sumeru with Deshret tech &  I believe that was the plan for the humans of Khaenriah.

# Natlan :

https://preview.redd.it/kgb7o6aidytf1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3468b2ae613457e0da17c734d2dba9d4eacc3e6

The main idea in Natlan was that a combat tournament is held to choose the best warriors from the region to battle the Abyss & prevent it from corrupting the information of the people's past stored in the Night Kingdom.

The humans rely on Sacred Flame & they recieve blessings of the wayobs in the form of the Ancient Names thanks to the previous God of the region who had recieved help from external entity.

With the help of 2 outlanders the God of the region defeats the external threat. But using the blessing from the external entity meant that the God was bound to die, but one of the outlander actually sacrifices themself in exchange of a deal to spare the God of the region.

We also learn that the dragons had survived & they went underground the Volcano Montain where they decided to turn themselves into phlogiston data. One of the dragons actually saw the failure that their species was moving towards, so they chose to help the humans by sharing & teaching them how to use the energy system of the dragons.

  
**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

\- The idea of Ancient names is symbolizing the Visions & the tournament is symbolizing the Archon War.

\- The idea of dragons going undeground is symbolizing Khaenriah. Also, the idea of protecting the Night Kingdom from the Abyss is symbolizing the idea of protecting Irminsul that is also underground.

\- Mavuika is symbolizing the heavently principles, MC Traveler is representing the second descender & Capitano is representing the Third Descender. Ronova probably be representing the external help outside of Teyvat (could be one of the witches).

\- Kukulkan is representing one of the moons who betrayed the dragonkind.



# Nod Krai, Snezhnaya & Khaenriah:

**Observations, Sidenotes & Speculation:**

Nod Krai is going to be all about the moons without a doubt. I think the moons' stories are going to parallel the role of Shades & Celestia.

As for Snezhnaya, I think it will be about the idea of a govenment being run with an empty throne that is being instructed by the servants who think they are following the desires of the ruler. Basically, the empty throne Snezhnaya will symbolize the empty throne of Celestia & just like the heavenly principles, the Tsaritsa is trying to live among the humans of Teyvat until the endgame.

I think because of the time spent amongst the people of Teyvat, both the heavenly principles (who i think is Paimon is a part of) & The Tsaritsa will relearn about humanity by forming connections with others & they will find an alternative way to save Teyvat without destroying everything (once again).

As for Khaenriah, my current speculation is that it is symbolizing the events of the First Human Civilization & its fall due to humans trying to defy the gods by becoming or creating new gods resulting in some sort of abyssal invasion paralleling the return of the dragon king & with that we will come full circle.

  
The end is the Beginning...

I was unsure if I should share the compilation of my half baked ideas since (Nod Krai basically threw a wrench into the works) I have to wait for one more year to confirm if any part of my ideas stick the landing. And I wanted to be done with these brain farts. On the other hand, I don't really mind being wrong with my speculations as I find the process of making theories more fascinating than actually getting them correct. 

So, if you have read this, feel free to share your agreements, disagreements as well as any of your speculations that are adjacent or even better than mine. Also, if I have made any mistakes in the post in terms of established lore, please correct me in the comments. There is always a chance of making mistakes in long posts & I dont mind getting corrected.

Thanks for reading.

1o3j8jn,all,Gender-locked classes in Battlefield 6 trigger outrage in r/battlefield,"**Source**: [Classes should have both Male and Female default skins to appease everyone.. Locking Genders to a Class is ridiculous. : r/Battlefield](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o3bvzd/classes_should_have_both_male_and_female_default/)

**Context:** Battlefield 6 just launched with its signature class system as seen pre 2042 (before they updated it) that includes Assault, Medic, Support and Recon.  Generally, most if not all battlefield games before BFV had exclusively male characters in those classes.

Now in BF6, both Allies (NATO) and Enemies (PAX ARMATA)  have almost equal distribution of males and females in each of those factions. Genders are locked here thereby not being able to pick whom to play as.

1o2vieg,all,"Rose Burket and Roger Atkison were brutally murdered in a hotel in Williamsburg, Iowa, on September 12, 1980. Despite the bizarre crime scene, similarities to other murders, evidence collected, and a list of suspects, this case remains unsolved.","**The Crime Scene**

It was around 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 13, 1980, when a housekeeper working at the Holiday Inn in the Amana Colonies near Williamsburg, Iowa, arrived at room 260. She had been cleaning other rooms, and the guests in 260 were set to check out. And by this time, they should have been gone already. 

The housekeeper knocked on the door and got no answer. She knocked several times, tried calling, and tried the door, but it was locked. But they could hear that a television was on inside the room. The housekeeper had to get a passkey to open the door, and when she entered, she first saw feet in the bed. She walked in further and discovered two bodies in the room. She got her manager, who then called the police. 

The crime scene, I believe, offers a lot of interesting things to consider in terms of offender behavior, so here is a condensed version of what I found after combing through years of reporting and finding crime scene photos: 

The room was a standard hotel room (from the 80s), it had one queen or double-sized bed, end tables on each side of the bed, there was a small table and chair, there was a TV, and a long dresser/desk combo. The hotel room had a window, but in crime scene photos, it is completely covered by curtains. 

The victims, later identified as Rose Burkert and Roger Atkison, were found lying side by side, face down, on the bed. Rose was almost entirely covered by the comforter; it appears that just the top of her head was visible, and the comforter was soaked in blood. Only Roger’s lower half was covered; his torso and head/arms were visible. 

Rose was fully clothed except possibly socks and shoes, and Roger was only in his undershorts. Roger’s arms are upward and bent at the elbow, almost as if he had his hands covering the back of his head. 

Both Rose and Roger sustained multiple blows primarily to the back of the head with an “ax or hatchet” like instrument with a 3 and a half inch blade, which was never found at the scene. 

Rose had twelve wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat, and Roger had seven wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat, and a possible defensive wound to his hands (multiple fingers had been severed). There was no evidence of sexual assault of either Rose or Roger.

Blood and brain matter were all over the headboard, wall, sheets, and carpet. There was a lot of blood on the comforter near where Rose’s head is, but I have not found information on whether the blanket was pulled up to cover her before or after she was attacked. 

The hotel room was in disarray, and Rose and Roger’s items are described as having been “rifled through”. Rose’s wallet, a possible key chain, a deck of cards, and Roger’s glasses were lying on “her side” of the bed, near where the pillow would be. The wallet had blood on it. 

On “Roger’s side” of the bed, two chairs had been pulled up, and on one of the chairs a white (I believe) towel had been draped over it, covering where you would sit and also the back of the chair. On the floor in front of those two chairs, the contents of Roger's wallet had been taken out and thrown on the floor, some items wrapped up. There were also soap shavings all over the floor. 

Their belongings are all over the floor in front of the long dresser, the TV, and under the desk portion, as well as scattered on top of it. The items, based on the photos, and what has been written in articles appear to be a brown purse, a white gym type bag, what loos like some articles of clothing, a small notebook, some hair brushes, a tube of maybe chapstick, some papers, and something an article described as a “hot lather machine” (apparently a machine that would dispense warm shaving cream).

On top of the desk, it looks like some toiletries, maybe a perfume, more keys, some coins, what looks like a driver's license with a female photo on it, and some sort of small case that is black on the outside and red on the inside. There’s an ashtray and more papers. Further to the left of all of that, there is something white. I can’t tell what it is, but it could be white packaging or paper. I am not sure. 

Approximately $200 was stolen from, I assume, Roger’s wallet, and a partial fingerprint was lifted from Rose’s belongings at the scene. 

In the bathroom, the sink was stained with blood, and a white towel was in it that had blood on it. During a 2015 review of the case, a previously unidentified sample of male DNA was located on one of these towels. A tube of Crest toothpaste was on the bathroom counter, and toothpaste had been squirted into the bathtub. Based on the photos of the bathroom, I do not believe the shower or bathtub had been used, but that has never been confirmed in reporting. 

On the back of the bathroom door, only visible when light shines on it a certain way, the word “This” is visible, and investigators believe it was written using a bar of soap. Some reports say there was an entire message written on the door, but it was wiped away, leaving on the word “This”. 

There was no sign of forced entry, and you could only access the hotel rooms from the inside of the hotel property. Room 260 was located on the opposite side of the hotel property, on the opposite side of where the front desk would be located. The hotel was located right off the interstate.

Rose’s vehicle was parked in the parking lot in a handicap spot. The hotel was completely booked that weekend for a “mortician’s convention”. No one interviewed at the hotel heard anything unusual coming from their room or saw anyone “lurking”.



**Rose and Roger**

Rose and Roger were identified, and they learned more about the victims. Rose was a single mother to a two-year-old, and Roger was married, not to Rose, but to another woman. Both were, from what I understand, from the St. Joseph, Missouri area.

I have been able to find out very little about Rose’s life, unfortunately, but this is a summary of what I know. Rose Burkert was a 22-year-old mother of a 2 year old daughter. She was a nurse-trainee/aide who worked at a nursing home in Savannah, Missouri. Some reports say she had recently quit to go back to nursing school to pursue a career in nursing. 

The father of Rose’s daughter wasn’t in the picture and did not provide financial support. Based on my research, it appears as though Rose understood from the moment she was pregnant that she would be raising her daughter on her own. I have not seen any reporting indicating the father of Rose’s child was involved in any way. 

Roger Atkison was 32-years-old and worked as a telephone installer/repairman. Previously, he had served in the Navy for two years during the Vietnam War in a medical capacity. 

After his service he married his high school sweetheart, Marcella, the two had been married for 7 years at the time of his murder. There were clear problems happening in their marriage, which we will get into. Marcella, who wrote a book about her husband's murder a few years ago, wrote this about their marriage: 

*“I would describe our seven-year-old marriage as very typical. Roger worked but was not gone excessive amounts of time for me to suspect anything. We were just like any other typical American couple working and trying to accomplish the normal things of buying a house, remodeling and furnishing it, taking a vacation now and then, and trying to start a family. We were both active in a local group we started for the rights of non-smokers. And Roger was the Vice president of the local Solar Energy Club of which I was also a member. We served in our local church by both singing in the adult choir, singing duets, teaching Children’s Sunday School, and Roger drove the church bus and worked at maintaining the buses in good working order. Yes, things were not perfect in our marriage, but I trusted that as a Christian couple we could work out anything with God's help.”*



**Rose and Roger’s Affair**

Rose and Roger were having an affair. It is believed Rose and Roger met after Roger installed a telephone at her home in Missouri. It has been reported multiple times that there was a culture of “messing around” among the men who worked for the telephone company Roger was employed at, and that many of them would install phones improperly at women's homes so they would be called back to the house. It is believed this is how Roger and Rose met. It is also believed that this is not the only woman Roger had an affair with.

In a 1992 article in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Sheriff Slockett (the sheriff at the time) said he had come to the conclusion that nearly everyone in St Joseph, Missouri, who knew both Rose and Roger knew that Roger was cheating on his wife, and that the two were seeing each other. 

Despite this, Marcella said she did not learn of the affair until after the murders, when police told her he was found killed with another woman, and a woman named Tammy, who is described as Rose’s best friend at the time, said she was not aware of Roger. 





**Rose and Roger's Last Movements**

Marcella last saw Roger on Monday, September 8th. He left to go work on a job in Kahoka, Missouri. She said Roger told her, “I will be working at the job in Kahoka for the next two weeks, including the weekend, without any time off.” 

She said at this time they weren't separated, weren’t considering divorce, and that they had had sex the night before he left. 

Marcella spoke to Roger again over the phone on Wednesday, September 10th, and it was a normal conversation, with nothing seeming to be out of the ordinary.

Rose had left her daughter with a friend she worked with on Wednesday, September 10, 1980. Rose then traveled to the town of Kahoka, Missouri, and checked into a hotel there, saying she was Roger’s wife. 

The two stayed with each other the night of the 10th and 11th, and on Friday the 12th, they drove in Rose’s car to the Holiday Inn in Amana, near Williamsburg, Iowa. They drove up Highway 218 and I-80 between 5 and 7:30 pm. According to my research, they registered under the names “Mr. and Mrs. Roger Burkert”. 

According to the episode of The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes, Rose and Roger receive a key to room 260 around 7:40 pm the night of Friday, September 12th. 

The hotel was completely booked for the mortician convention, and Rose and Roger reportedly were only able to get a room because there was a last-minute cancellation. They also, according to Marcella’s book, parked Rose’s car in a handicap-accessible parking spot to the side, near the back of the hotel, and her vehicle was still there when investigators got to the scene. 

When they got to their room, around 8 pm, Rose attempted to call her friend Shirley, who lived in St. Joseph. But Shirley was at work (or doing laundry, according to other reports) and was quoted in the Quad City Times article as saying, “I didn’t get the call, I imagine she was calling to check on \[her daughter\]”. So Shirley, I am assuming, is the friend Rose dropped her daughter off with before leaving. 

At 8:30 pm, Shirley attempted to call Rose back at the hotel, but there was no answer. 

Marcella said that three calls were made either to or from the hotel room. Rose’s call to the babysitter would be one, the babysitter trying to call back would be two, but the explanation for the third call is unclear. 

According to reporting, Shirley knew that Rose was going to meet Roger in Kahoka, and other articles say that Roger’s coworkers at the telephone company knew the two were spending the weekend together in Amana. 





**Persons of Interest**

Many individuals have been investigated; here are just SOME of the individuals who have come up multiple times in reports: 

**Marcella**. Roger and Marcella’s marriage was in trouble, and many in their circle knew it. The two had struggled with fertility for years, and had also tried adoption with no luck. Marcella said that in the months before his murder, something seemed to be troubling Roger. Marcella said in the months before he was murdered she outright asked him if there was “someone else”. Roger replied, after a long pause, “Oh, no one in particular, but there are two or three women who live in the Savannah area that I could easily step into the father role of their children”. She didn't question him further on that but asked if he was considering a divorce, and he replied “I don't know”. She says divorce wasn't brought up again.

After the murders, when Marcella learned of Rose and the affairs, she had many visitors to offer their condolences. One was a pastor that Roger had gone to for counseling two weeks prior to his murder. The paster said Roger had told him about Rose, and that he was “conflicted on what to do with the whole situation”. According to the pastor, Roger had become attached to Rose’s 2-year-old daughter. 

Roger’s brother and wife were suspicious of Marcella, and a 1992 article where the two are interviewed reads:

*“Three things stick in the minds of Larry and Elizabeth: the day before Roger’s murder, Marcella stopped at their home and, uncharacteristically, broke down crying.* 

*‘Did she know something was going to happen?’ Larry now asks.* 

*“Larry and Elizabeth are quick to note, too, that Marcella stood to cash in on life insurance policies.* 

*“And they can’t get out of their mind that chairs were pulled up to the beds at the motel-room murder scene as if people who knew one another were engaged in conversation.* 

*‘Somebody, more than one person, sat there and talked before they did it,” says Larry”.*



After the murders, Marcella hired her own investigators, one of them named Herald Martin. He said he was “able to find out little” to shed light on who murdered Roger and Rose. Still, he did strike luck and was able to secure double-indemnity life insurance money for Marcella, which the insurance companies had either been refusing to pay or were taking their time paying. 

Court records from Iowa County District Court, in a wrongful-death lawsuit Marcella had actually filed against the Holiday Inn, indicate that Roger’s estate included payments of $49,287, $20,320, and $71,000 from insurance companies. 

Regarding the wrongful death lawsuit Marcella had filed against the Holiday Inn, she filed it, saying that the hotel didn’t provide adequate security and that this contributed to the death of Roger. That lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court, and both parties agreed to keep the sum of that settlement private.

While there is a clear motive, Marcella had an alibi. She was babysitting in Missouri the weekend of the murders (something she and Roger did for extra money frequently).

Marcella believes the person responsible was someone out for revenge on Rose, and specifically, an allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend. 

**Danny.** Multiple reports indicate Rose’s ex-boyfriend and possible former fiancé (called Danny) was particularly abusive, and had been stalking her in the weeks before her murder. Just weeks before, Rose allegedly went to law enforcement in Savannah, Missouri, and said that if something ever happened to her, it would be her ex-boyfriend. Note: I have not been able to confirm if a report like this was ever taken, though I have reached out to various law enforcement agencies to see if they keep records like this. 

Tammy, Rose’s friend, said Danny had been following the two of them and had left “threatening notes” on her vehicle. There are rumors that Rose had gotten a dog for protection and that Danny had killed the dog and hung it from a tree on her property. But again, this is not something I have been able to confirm. 

An article by RJ Cooper in the St Joseph News-Press, though, says the ex-boyfriend “came up with a solid alibi and eventually passed a polygraph.”  

Despite this, something in Marcella’s book stuck out to me, and it’s from her time with Roger in the weeks before his murder. 

She says that throughout the summer that he was troubled by something and didn't seem to be himself. And Roger met Rose in June, so if he had been considering leaving Marcella, that makes sense to me. But she said that during the weekend of September 1, 1980, the two went to Branson, Missouri, to celebrate their 7th wedding anniversary. She said they camped out to save money, but during one of the nights, they stayed in a motel. To Marcella, nothing really stuck out in her mind as being unusual or off, except for one thing. 

She said that as they were getting ready for bed on the night they stayed in the motel, Roger took a chair that was in the room and propped it under the doorknob of the room’s door. 

She asked him why he was doing that, and he just shrugged and said no big deal, but it was really weird to Marcella because he had never done that before, and because they had previously been camping in tents and he didn’t bother securing entrances those nights.

To me, based on what people have reported, Rose’s ex-boyfriend/fiancé had been stalking her, and it was escalating enough that in the weeks before she was murdered, she went to the police and specifically said if anything happened to her, it would be the ex. Then, in the weeks before, Roger is also propping a door up in a motel? 

Could the escalation be that the ex found out about Roger? Something makes me believe that at least Rose believed her relationship with Roger was more serious and beyond an affair. Tammy said Rose wasn't the type to run off with a married man, that she believed Rose thought Roger was going to leave Marcella to be with her. Roger’s pastor even told Marcella after the murders that Roger had become attached to Rose’s child. Did the ex-boyfriend find out about the potential seriousness of their relationship? Is that why it escalated in those last weeks?

**The Hotel Bartender.** According to the 1992 Cedar Rapids Gazette article, the day after the murders, there was a bartender who worked at the Holiday Inn who up and left, leaving a paycheck behind. The bartender worked at the hotel but lived in his truck in the parking lot. Another article says Rose had had a confrontation with this bartender, though I haven’t seen that reported anywhere outside of this one 2009 article. 

The bartender fled, his truck was found abandoned in Iowa City, and he made his way to North Carolina, joined the Army, and was sent to Germany to serve. The 1992 article says, “Only when he returned to the states did investigators interview him. Slockett says it took nine tries before investigators concluded the bartender finally passed polygraph testing.”

There is no other information on this individual. 

**Charles Hatcher.** There was a lot of reporting in the 80s showing investigators were very much attempting to link or rule out Charles Hatcher as a suspect. Hatcher was Marcella’s uncle (her father's brother), and he just so happened to be a serial killer. He had apparently escaped a mental health center in Nebraska just days before the murders. Long story short on this, he was eventually ruled out. 



**Similar Cases**

Throughout the investigation, there was an effort to determine if Rose and Roger's murder could be linked to another murder that occurred on June 25, 1980, at a hotel in Galesburg, Illinois. This case involved a 25-year-old man named William Kyle, who was killed by multiple strikes to the back of his head with an “ax-like” instrument (never found at the scene). At this scene, toothpaste was squirted on the floor near his foot. 

In the episode of the DNA of Murder with Paul Holes, they really focus on a potential connection between Rose and Roger’s case and William Kyle’s. They also connect the October 1970 murder of 23-year-old Jack McDonald. McDonald was murdered at a hotel in Meridian, Mississippi. His body was found in a position identical to William Kyle, he had been struck multiple times with an “ax-like” instrument (never found at the scene), and toothpaste had allegedly been squirted into the toilet.

Throughout this Paul Holes episode, Holes becomes more and more certain that all three of these murders were committed by the same man. He provides his theory to investigators at all three agencies and provides suggestions on items to test. There are strong similarities, and in 2020 the FBI put out a VICAP alert, laying out the similarities between these three cases (hotels off the interstate, toothpaste, similar murder weapon) and asking the public and other law enforcement agencies for information on cases with similar elements. 

And in this episode, investigators in the Rose and Roger case said that their prevailing theory had been that the person responsible for Rose and Roger’s murder was someone who knew them, but that based on the information and connections to these other cases, they were reconsidering. 



**Raymundo Esparza**

With the connection between these three cases came the name of a suspect: Raymundo Esparza. Esparza was seen by witnesses around the hotel where William Kyle was murdered on the night of the murder. According to the Paul Holes episode, Esparza was a “drifter” and heroin addict who had actually been found loitering near railroad tracks on the night of Kyle’s murder. Police were called, they picked up Esparza, and allegedly dropped him off at the hotel where Kyle was eventually murdered. 

Esparza was living in Iowa, and he was questioned by Illinois investigators in connection with William Kyle’s death, but he was ultimately never charged due to a lack of evidence. 

Now, Paul Holes recommended that investigators test the DNA found on the towel at Rose and Roger’s scene against Raymundo Esparza. I had not seen any reporting on whether this was ever done. Still, I emailed the Iowa County Sheriff’s Office to see if there had been any recent developments in the case. I asked specifically about Raymundo Esparza*,* and this is what I received back: 

*“The case is awaiting improvements in DNA analysis.  We have an incomplete DNA profile that may belong to our suspect.   We have enough of a profile to confirm or deny a suspect, but not enough for familial DNA exploration.  We are hoping to find a technology that can assist with filling in the blanks, but right now, we aren't there yet.  Raymundo Esparza is not a match for our DNA.”*



**Closing/Discussion Questions**

All three of these cases remain unsolved. This was a huge case to research, so apologies if my write-up is subpar. This took me forever, and I have a larger write-up that is going on 20k words, so I did my best to pare it down. 

**Some discussion questions:** 

* What do you make of the state of Rose and Roger’s crime scene? While statistically it would make sense for the perpetrator to be someone who knew them, the scene has so many strange elements that make me believe it was a stranger. 
* Do you believe the connections between the three cases are a mere coincidence or indicative of a serial killer? 
* What do you make of the toothpaste at the scene? Illinois investigators theorized that if Esparza was the offender, and if these were sexually motivated homicides, that because he was a heroin addict he may have experienced erectile dysfunction, and the squirting of the toothpaste was a method of ejaculation.

**[33bits](https://opencritic.com/outlet/735/33bits)** - [Fernando Sánchez](https://opencritic.com/critic/6808/fernando-s-nchez) - *Spanish* - [94 / 100](https://portal.33bits.net/analisis-absolum/)

>Absolum combines the intensity of classic beat 'em ups with the strategic depth of a modern roguelite, offering highly satisfying combat and replayability that keeps you coming back for more. The narrative progresses with each attempt, the characters and builds offer great variety, and the audiovisual presentation is beautiful and exquisitely crafted, making Absolum a highly recommended experience.

**[AnaitGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/691/anaitgames)** - [Víctor Manuel Martínez García](https://opencritic.com/critic/6087/v-ctor-manuel-mart-nez-garc-a) - *Spanish* - [10 / 10](https://www.anaitgames.com/analisis/analisis-de-absolum)

>Guard Crush polishes, enhances and elevates everything learned in their previous beat 'em ups to, with the help of a sensible roguelite structure, create their masterpiece.

-------------

**[Analog Stick Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/894/analog-stick-gaming)** - [Jeff M Young](https://opencritic.com/critic/10614/jeff-m-young) - [8 / 10](https://www.analogstickgaming.com/game-reviews-1/2025/10/6/absolum)

>Absolum, regardless of its somewhat bland world and story, has everything else extremely locked down, including a fantastic soundtrack that features the likes of Mick Gordon and many other talented folk. Still, the title's incredibly strong gameplay and eye-catching visuals, along with its co-op nature, make this an absolute easy recommendation on those things alone. Whether local or online, Absolum is a visually stunning Beat’em Up that almost lands that perfect punch.

-------------

**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/absolum-review-rougelite/)

>Absolum delivers a truly special roguelite experience. By reining in some of the random elements, it’s able to create a smooth-running story that allows those with less than infinite time an experience they can enjoy.

-------------

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Zubi Khan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4059/zubi-khan) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/absolum-pc-review/)

**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [82 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/absolum-review/)

>Absolum enters the crowded roguelike space with a refreshing and appealing art style and classic-feeling beat-em-up mechanics. Playable solo or in 2-person co-op, each of Absolum’s characters caters to a very specific playstyle, and it’s fun to switch between them. Although character progression is a little slow, and the movement mechanics occasionally frustrate, Absolum should appeal to fans of engaging action adventures, roguelikes, and brawlers. Absolum has something for almost everyone.

**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [8 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/absolum-review/)

>The world of Talamh was created with thoughtfulness and feels like a character of its own volition. You've got an interesting premise that lets you explore a pretty incredible place, and it's filled with dangers, treasures, and a whole lot of enemies to defeat. Without a doubt, if there's one beat 'em up this year that's got the rizz, it's Absolum.

-------------

**[Couch Soup](https://opencritic.com/outlet/938/couch-soup)** - [Iain McParland](https://opencritic.com/critic/11014/iain-mcparland) - [9.5 / 10](https://couchsoup.com/absolum-is-the-roguelike-revelation-of-a-side-scrolling-beat-em-up/)

>Absolum is a revelation in the genre, the beautiful love-child of Hades and Streets of Rage 4. I cannot believe that this game exists, but I thank all of the Gods it does.

-------------

**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - Shane Limbaugh - [9.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/absolum-review/)

>Absolum is a game that will be remembered not only for its incredible scenery but also for its fantastic gameplay. From the very first moments, it's clear that Absolum is something special and unique. A mix of powerful mechanics and expert game design will make players leave every session wanting more. Absolum will undoubtedly make a name for itself as one of the greatest games of the year. Whether it's with a friend or solo, beating up hordes of enemies has never been so much fun.

**[Endless Mode](https://opencritic.com/outlet/972/endless-mode)** - [Elijah Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/6743/elijah-gonzalez) - [8.8 / 10](https://www.endlessmode.com/article/absolum-review-dark-fantasy-beat-em-up-that-packs-a-punch)

>Not many games can claim to be truly best-in-class at something, but Absolum’s beat ‘em up action makes a convincing case for itself.

-------------

**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Farley Santos](https://opencritic.com/critic/7342/farley-santos) - *Portuguese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/absolum-analise-review.html)

>Absolum combines beat 'em up with roguelite elements to create an immersive and nuanced experience. The game offers deep combat, consistent progression systems, and a visually striking world, despite stumbling upon some structural repetition and limited variations in areas and powers. Its strength lies in the balance between technical precision and tactical variety, rewarding mastery and pattern recognition without sacrificing the fast-paced rhythm typical of beat 'em ups. Even without reinventing the genre, Absolum demonstrates its own identity.

**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Richard Seagrave](https://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2025/10/absolum-review/)

>With its stunning visuals, beautiful soundtrack and gratifying gameplay, Absolum will draw you in from the outset. And thanks to its roguelike elements it has plenty of longevity and depth. One of the best games of 2025, this is a must-play whether you're a fan of beat 'em ups or roguelikes.

-------------

**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

>Infusing a classic beat-'em-up structure with a modern roguelike loop is a match made in heaven.

>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the team of veteran beat ‘em up developers made another great beat ‘em up game. Absolum evolves the best parts of classic beat ‘em up action and weaves it with an original story, a compelling world, and roguelike elements. This doesn’t seem like a game that should work as well as it does, but it’s some of the most fun I’ve had with a co-op game this year.

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Chris Schilling](https://opencritic.com/critic/229/chris-schilling) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/absolum-review/)

>This feels like it belongs firmly in 2025 – and it's good enough to have you wondering what other bygone genres would benefit from similarly thoughtful, lavish treatment.

-------------

**[Gamesource Italia](https://opencritic.com/outlet/959/gamesource-italia)** - [Matteo Cadeddu](https://opencritic.com/critic/11237/matteo-cadeddu) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://www.gamesource.it/recensioni/absolum-recensione/)

>Absolum is truly a well-made title. The folks at Guard Crush and Supamonks, with the help of publisher DOTEMU, have created a magnificent work in virtually every respect. I would only advise against this title if you deeply dislike the genre, but even then, I would urge you to give it a chance. The artwork elevates the good gameplay and tells an engaging story that will keep you company for many hours.

**[Gaming Nexus](https://opencritic.com/outlet/104/gaming-nexus)** - [Jeremy Duff](https://opencritic.com/critic/516/jeremy-duff) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/16280/Absolum/)

>A fast-paced blend of beat 'em up and rogue-like mechanics, Absolum starts off simple but evolves to reveal surprising depth and experience that will keep you come back for just one more run.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Ravi Sinha](https://opencritic.com/critic/1193/ravi-sinha) - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/absolum-review-absolute-beat-em-up-cinema)

>Absolum is absolutely recommended for beat 'em up fans thanks to the pedigree of its developers. It's also a surprisingly deep rogue-lite with a well-developed world, bolstered all the more by its incredible presentation.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - *Spanish* - [92 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-absolum-mejor-beat-em-hemos-jugado-anos-1486538)

>Absolum is one of the most polished and varied beat 'em ups of all time, which is saying something. Its progression system keeps you playing. It's among the elite in 2025.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Will Borger](https://opencritic.com/critic/1205/will-borger) - [7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-review)

>Absolum is an excellent beat ‘em up let down by a roguelite structure that doesn’t serve it.

-------------

**[Insider Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/908/insider-gaming)** - [Michael Straw](https://opencritic.com/critic/3938/michael-straw) - [5 / 5](https://insider-gaming.com/absolum-review-a-must-play-roguelite/)

>Absolum doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t need to. It just nails what makes these types of games fun with tight combat, satisfying progression, and visuals that make every punch and throw look special. It’s fast, it’s beautiful, and it’s got heart. And that’s exactly what you want from a game like this. The best thing you can say about Absolum is that it's a game that everyone needs to play.

-------------

**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) - [90 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/10/absolum-review-kkp/)

>With awesome controls and simple-yet-tough-to-master gameplay, a challenging bout of levels and bosses that require you to make use of the perma-upgrades option given, and tons of replayability coupled with a beautiful aesthetic, Absolum is one side-scrolling trip you don't want to skip.

>Just get ready to eat dirt over and over again, and get a reliable friend over to help you out.

**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [8.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/absolum-review/)

>Absolum is a confident side-scroller with satisfying, punchy combat and a good spread of characters and skills

**[Manual dos Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games)** - [Nathan Manoel](https://opencritic.com/critic/11454/nathan-manoel) - *Portuguese* - [8.5 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com/review-absolum-25/)

>Absolum is a great beat 'em up with excellent gameplay, stunning visuals, and incredible soundtracks. However, the game falls short as a roguelite, offering a story that takes a while to pick up and little variation between runs.

>Absolum is an on-par experience to Dragon's Crown, but a superior game in terms of its key metrics. Its combat, collectible augmentations, and planning are exceptionally well-formulated, ensuring no run is ever quite the same and its strategic options and play-styles are ever-deepening. It's incredibly impressive in its reconstitution of arcade, role-playing, and roguelike formats, evolving them into something fresh and exciting.To that end, it's one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be. If you don't enjoy the idea of repetition and grind, you may not fall in love with its initial five hours, but the momentum for one-more-go becomes so compelling after a while that it's impossible to relinquish the pad.

>Absolum isn't a game that reinvents the wheel, it has its own unique takes, and it brings back an underused genre, which is pretty cool, alongside a very trendy genre, and it's fun in its own right. It has its drawbacks, but they don't detract from its positives.

**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Jordan Rudek](https://opencritic.com/critic/5065/jordan-rudek) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/72837/absolum-switch-review)

>undefined.There's more to do after rolling credits the first time, but my main take away is just how good the combat feels and how gorgeous everything looks while you're doing it. Absolum is made by a team that understands how to make a great brawler, like Shredder's Revenge and Streets of Rage 4, so you can expect a similar level of polish and chops. I ended up clearing the game with every character because I was having such a good time, and with all the awesome games I still haven't played from September, that's proof positive that any beat-'em-up fan should absolutely be checking out Absolum.

>Absolum masterfully blends classic beat 'em up action with roguelite progression and mature fantasy storytelling to create something truly special. Dotemu delivers crispy combat, meaningful worldbuilding, and enough content to keep you hooked for 25+ hours and beyond. Whether you're chasing nostalgia or craving innovation, this is an essential pickup.

>So Absolum is ultimately a beat 'em up with a bit more depth and progression than we've seen before in this style of game that has been so resistant to change since it was born in the arcades. Absolum lacks the extensive variance of a true roguelike, but delivers enough intricacy to push the genre into a more interesting space than it's ever occupied.

>Absolum is one of the big surprises of 2025. What could have been just another roguelite has turned out to be a brilliant combination of beat 'em up with a deep combat system and the roguelite genre. Dotemu and the studios involved have managed to make each run intense, strategic, and tremendously fun, both solo and in co-op.

>Absolum is a fantastic new intellectual property, the result of another successful partnership between DotEmu and Guard Crush. The game innovates by fusing the beat'em-up genre with roguelite, making it unlike anything else on the market. Its solid design and constant surprise factor make this ""rogue-em-up"" a highly recommended game, even for those who are frustrated by randomness.

>An absolute treat that kept me coming back for more. Absolum does a lot right, and it's all due to the hard work of DotEmu and Guard Crush's previous efforts. With incredible combat, stunning visuals, and a soundtrack that packs so much variety, it's hard to imagine how DotEmu can top themselves after Absolum.

>Absolum is everything I’ve wanted in a roguelite action game. Its combat is deep, expressive, and highly reactive, letting skill and mastery shine instead of leaning too heavily on rituals. Each character feels genuinely distinct, and the forward progression always pushes you back in with more power and tools to experiment with. Every strike, kick, and launcher is animated with absurd detail, and the art direction never stops impressing. Absolum hits hard, stays stylish, and never lets up until you’ve seen everything it has to offer.

>For people who played Streets of Rage 4’s roguelite DLC and wanted more, Absolum scratches that itch and then some. For traditionalists, it might not be your cup of tea because of the structure, but it makes a valiant effort to get there and endear itself to all. Just be sure you know exactly what you're biting off.

>I can't stop playing this game! Great as a beat'em up, great as a roguelite, Absolum is just wonderful as a combination of the two genres. The cherry on top – but maybe is the foundation below – is a glorious lore and a brilliant narration that will keep you wanting more.

>Absolum blends the best of 2D beat 'em ups and roguelike design into a loop that's challenging, unpredictable, and downright addictive. It doesn't reinvent either genre, but its tight combat, branching paths, and stunning presentation make it a must-play for fans of both. Despite being Dotemu's first original IP, you'd never know it. This is a masterclass in design that kept me hooked, even as it repeatedly kicked my teeth in.

>If I could have Absolum without the roguelite elements – and admittedly, a few less glitches – then I would have my ideal 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, the best I've ever played. As it is, the roguelite structure and its inconsistent delivery unfortunately lowers the overall experience. It's still a very enjoyable game, even with these issues, but this was so close to being a classic of the genre.

>Absolum brilliantly merges the slick, progression-driven feel of Hades with satisfying, visually stunning beat 'em up combat, offering a feature-rich co-op experience. Despite its gorgeous animation and responsive systems, the game suffers from noticeable enemy repetition and requires some tedious late-game grinding, slightly detracting from its otherwise stellar genre combination.

>Beat em ups are a genre reluctant to take chances or step outside of tradition. As a result, most modern experiences feel rote by the end of their short 4-6 hours. Absolum is the best beat em up of all time because Dotemu understood that to make the game a complete package it had to stretch beyond the restrictions of the genre. Absolum is a beat em up first and a roguelite second, but above everything, it's a magical experience that has the power to transcend genre boundaries.

>Absolum is pretty much everything you could want in a roguelike beat-'em-up. It's engaging, constantly varied, fun to play, gorgeous to look at, and it's pretty much a nonstop good time. The only way I can see a fan of the beat-'em-up genre not liking Absolum is if they don't like roguelikes. Even then, I could see it melting some hearts. It's a delight from start to finish, and the game is nearly impossible to put down.

1o1fp7s,all,accidentally found out I am the son of the dragon king,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, midterm season is hitting me like a 7-foot tall squirrel from Queen's Park. I was in Robarts, 13th floor, just absolutely getting destroyed by a MAT137 problem set. I'm staring at this proof, my brain is leaking out of my ears, and I’m pretty sure the letters on the page started swimming in front of my eyes.

I got so stressed that I slammed my fist on the table, and I swear to you, the air around my hand shimmered with golden light and a tiny wisp of smoke came out of my nose. Like, actual smoke. It smelled like sandalwood and ozone. The person across from me just stared, and I mumbled something about a weird vape pen and ran to the bathroom.

I splashed water on my face, and when I looked in the mirror, there was this faint, glowing scale pattern on my forehead. It faded after a few seconds.

Naturally, I did what any of us would do: I ignored it and went back to the P-set, because my academic validation is more important than a minor hallucination.

But it happened again when I was trying to buy coffee at Sid Smith and my T-Card didn't work. I got flustered, the debit machine flickered, and all the lights in the building dimmed for a second.

Long story short, I called my dad to complain about my life. He was weirdly quiet and then just sighed and said, ""The celestial seal is weakening. You're drawing on the family power.""

I was like, ""What family power? The power of pattern baldness?""

And he goes, ""No, son. Our family. You are the heir to the Dragon Throne of the Eastern Sea. I am Ao Kuang, the Dragon King. Your real name is Ao Bing.""

So... yeah. Turns out my dad isn't a 'logistics manager' in Shanghai. He's a literal dragon king who controls the tides and rains. All those childhood stories he told me weren't stories. He expects me to come home after this semester to start learning how to manage rainfall patterns and appease the celestial bureaucracy. He says my 'university degree' is a cute mortal hobby.

I'm sitting here in my dorm at New College with two midterms and an essay due next week. My dad is texting me (on a magic jade tablet, no less) asking if I've mastered my hydrokinesis yet. I haven't even mastered how to get a decent grade in ECO101.

So, my question for you all is:

Does the registrar have a form for this? Is ""destined to rule the eternal tides and command the legions of the sea"" a valid reason to request a deferral? Should I add ""Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace"" to my LinkedIn and see if it helps with PEY applications?

TL;DR: Was cramming for calculus, accidentally discovered my dad is the Dragon King, and now I have a divine succession crisis on top of my academic one. What do I do?

1nzbvli,all,For new doctors,"This is a rant but a sad one. My mom recently got admitted in a hospital for subacute appendicitis. Me, being a post intern was coordinating and got her to the hospital. 


The first incident - The surgeon came and spoke, I introduced myself as a doctor and he told me the management plan. He explained it like I was his coworker and tbh it felt nice, after being treated like a compounder in my college. Before he left, he asked which speciality I was in - I told him I just finished internship and I'm preparing for neet. His face dropped, looked at me with confusion (idek disgust or something I couldn't even tell). Then he left, my dad just wanted to talk to him, so I took him to the surgeon and while clearing his doubts, his tone completely dampened and was cold. I felt weird but told myself I must be imagining things and let it go.


Secondly - We admitted her and next day I went to check on her. She was all good, taking NS and analgesics. Since they've put the NS in an infusion pump, it started beeping. I went over and silenced it. Suddenly both my parents started shouting at me why I did that and to leave it alone. Im like it'll keep beeping, I just silenced it, I'll go inform the nurse it's over. Both told me to stfu and not to cause any harm to my mother. I was just kinda shocked to see this coming from them. When my pgs trusted me completely to take care of a whole ward alone during a busy opd day, my own parents don't trust me with a stupid machine, it kinda broke me inside a little tbh.


Thirdly - I went to the hospital in a rather informal attire, my parents told me to go back home, dress nicely and come with my reg card. Felt normal at first but after the above incident, it kind of got to me that they just want me to show that there's a doctor in the family, while completely ignoring all my advice to take metformin, b12, htn tablets for the past 2 years. Just so you know, I took this course at my own discretion and nobody forced me, still they act like I'm unqualified to check the basics. Stuff like this keeps happening at home too, not getting much into that.

Finally - Before they shifted her, she was on NS as usual and the nurse who came and changed the bottles - forgot to tighten the injection port cap, so the NS kept leaking. Again I went over to just tighten it -again, my mom started shouting at me to call the nurse, I just tightened it and went back.


What I wanted to convey is - You might be feeling underconfident, incompetent, not socring enough marks, scared you'll forget the skills you picked up, and trying not to harm anyone or whatever - no matter what others tell you, even your own parents - never feel you're not enough, never put yourself down just because others told you, be confident in your skills and if you really feel you're missing out on something, make sure you learn it from any source you can - till you're a pro at it. MBBS doctors were enough to diagnose most of the diseases just 10-15yrs ago, now even the simplest thing is not allowed to do. This might sound petty at first, but it is quite significant when you add it all up, you're basically treated like an inferior quality doctor.

And for all the senior doctors - I'm pretty sure I've misread the surgeon but even if a MBBS doctor comes, pls do treat them with the same respect you'd give another coworker - try not to look down on them just because they're MBBS only. Not that I've encountered one who berates junior doctors as patients but I'm sure it's pretty common in this field.

So just be strong and hold your head high - you're just starting out, it's fine to make mistakes, but never push yourself down. Remember - even the pros were beginners once.

1o0j441,all,I've lived alone for over 25 years and I ❤ IT!,"Learn to love yourself and your space. Make it a space of no judgement. Make it your safe space. 

I made my home MY space to accommodate my wants and needs. Here's a few random ones:

I took the mirror off the medicine cabinet and replaced it with a curtain for my mental health needs. 

I turned the ""bedroom"" into my office and turned the ""dining room"" into my bedroom for light and noise reduction. I eat on the couch with a TV tray.

I have a Mini wifi speaker group with a speaker in 3 rooms and play music I love throughout my condo (4 rooms & 1 bath) every day. 

I  turned off all the clocks on my appliances for anxiety issues. 

I bought a small cold water washing machine (50 pounds) so I can do my laundry whenever.

I've always had plants and pets. I have had 4 dogs before I had joint issues, and now I have 2 cats.

How do you make your home YOURS? What do love about living solo?

(Hmm... exhaustion and caffeine gives me a massive headache. I still need to mend. Nose is a little better though.)

Antlers, Assumptions and Artillery

The door to his chamber opens and Observer Wu looks up to find that the man interrupting his meditation is Captain Rangi.

“Captain.” Observer Wu states.

“Observer. Are you breaking?” Captain Rangi is to the point. “Do we need to retreat?”

“No. I am...” Observer Wu takes a breath to regain the last of his composure. “I have encountered something today that reminds me of one of the most pivotal moments of my life.”

“In what way?”

“Captain. Have you ever encountered something that changes everything? A single moment that following which, nothing is ever the same? Where you can see into your life and know for absolute certain that you are a different person.”

“... Yes. My father was killed in a drunk driving incident. We were rammed head on by a drunkard who died instantly. As did my father. I was in the back, strapped in and safe. I was trapped in the car with my father’s corpse for an hour. The horns unceasing, the stench growing... I was eight years old.” Captain Rangi says grimly.

“I was twenty one. I had been a police officer for two years. A year of training after the waiting, two years of learning about the job and the politics. A routine inspection grew worse, and worse, and worse. It was a brothel. Specializing in drugged mothers. Their prize piece of meat was a woman so intoxicated with opium that it had influenced her breast milk. Which was being sold the ‘privilege’ of drinking it.”

“Dear god...”

“But that was not the worst of it. The worst was their... disposal chamber.”

“Their what?”

“The disposal chamber. The brothel specialized in lactating women. For a woman to lactate. She must be pregnant or to have given birth. But they had no use for the babes. Especially as most of them emerged heavily damaged by the drugs their mothers had had forced down their throats.”

“What?”

“They kept the bodies to scare people into compliance. To terrify and horrify them. Arranging the little corpses to stare out the door the moment you entered the room.”

“What did you do?”

“I dragged away the owners in cuffs. I dedicated my life and energies to making sure the nightmare was ended. Then kept myself endlessly clean. Flawlessly clean. Making sure they never got out. No room to wriggle away, no path to try and slip out.”

“And... how did that work?”

“The last man responsible for that nightmare died in prison ten years ago.” Observer Wu says. “The youngest of their victims saw the birth of her granddaughter two years ago. She named her first born son after me.”

“So... how are you holding up.”

“I just need... to process things. Despite everything I’ve seen, the image of a tormented, twisted child in the grip of death is... too familiar. But this one is a hybrid of another species, not a deformed innocent. Sick yes, but being cared for professionally. Close to death... but being kept away. It was however, far too close. Far too familiar. I needed a few minutes.”

“You’ve been here an hour.”

“Ah.” Observer Wu states. “To be fair I hadn’t set an alarm for my meditations.”

“The Undaunted on Centris retrieved information from the Floric there directly. The mother, grandmother and... other mother? Aunt? The body the child was born from are all being cared for in the proper methods. And the techniques involved are even helping heal the child.”

“Buddha is merciful.” Observer Wu notes.

“You know, you haven’t really referred to Buddha or anything specific faith wise before.” Captain Rangi notes.

“I’m still a little off balance.” Observer Wu says before taking in a deep breath. “But that no longer matters. I can return to my duties.” he says and begins moving. Captain Rangi stops him with a single hand to the chest.

“We will be staying on Zalwore for at least an additional twenty four hours to accommodate the leave.”

“Are you about to force medical leave on me?” Observer Wu asks.

“I would rather not. But I am willing to have it officially enforced if nothing else will get you to calm down and take time for yourself. Even machines need rest, even gods take breaks. We mortals must pace ourselves, and care for ourselves.” Captain Rangi says and Observer Wu slumps a little.

“You’re right. Will you oppose me getting a snack, and then taking a nap?”

“I encourage both.” Captain Rangi says. “And if you need to talk to someone without feeling like you’re giving things away. Well... I’m in the same position you are. And a burden shared is a burden halved.”

“Alright. Thank you, my friend.” Wu says and Rangi claps him on the shoulder.

“You’re welcome. Now, relax a bit. You need it.”

•-•-•Scene Change•-•-• (Undaunted Arcology, Western Face Gardens, Isolated Recovery Area, Zalwore)•-•-•

Hooktail watches as the hired botanists scurry around to plant the additional flowers and bushes near the Floric. His job is now to protect them and there are several other troops and Private Stream there as well to make sure no one tries anything.

But the Floric’s way of healing was... interesting. Numerous plants would actually devour and process toxic metals and poisons from the earth, and a Floric could only push out toxins from their system at a set speed normally. But if it was into completely clean earth, it would be notably faster and could even be accelerated. So having them surrounded by the plants that would eat the poisons in them was just sensible. Couple that with growth totems that would cause the Floric systems to basically start working in overtime and...

“Okay. We’re ready.” A Lirak woman says. “Are you sure they won’t try anything?”

“They’re half dead at best. How can they try anything?” Hooktail asks.

“I suppose.” She says and then activates the first totem. It causes a chain reaction and the numerous flowers, bushes and grasses start growing instantly. The Axiom effect passes to the poisoned Floric and they shudder at first. Then their colour starts shifting. Growing deeper, stronger and the slight splochess fade away. There is a shimmering, gleaming texture to the surrounding plants as they grow taller and taller.

“Is that?” Stem begins to ask before her hand reaches up above the now tall surrounding grasses. “Alphrin Grass. That’s... that’s the answer to Lead Poisoning... How?”

“One of ours went to The Distant Wild Embassy on Centris and got the information. You are neither abandoned nor alone. Your people are still with you, and we have you too.” Private Stream answers.

“... Why though? Why do so much for us?”

“It’s the right thing to do.”

“No one does anything just because It’s right.”

“We do, granted we’re also good at finding ways to prosper from it. But that’s just us learning to live with our goodie two shoes nature.”

“Is it now? What two shoes has to do with helping others aside, thank you. But how do you profit from this?”

“Simple. Floric need an advocate. Florics need a trading partner and Floric have access to the unique resources of your homeworlds. If the rest of the galaxy doesn’t want to deal with you, then being the middle man is where the money is. They pay us to keep you away, you pay us to keep them away, we’re making money either way and everyone’s happy.”

“That makes sense. Still... Undaunted for Middlemen? How strange.”

“We’re more than warriors. We’re diplomatic too.”

“I’m sure.”

“We’re being diplomatic now. You want to know how we profit? By providing a service. Make sense?”

“At least you’re not trying to sell me on the idea that you’re just good for the sake of good.”

“It’s a perk, and enough motivation for some. Others want money. Others want purpose. Others want novel experiences. People join The Undaunted for a lot of reasons. And there are plenty of reasons to help you.” Private Stream says before walking over. “Now, lie back down. I’ll wager there’s still a lot of crud in your system, and we didn’t set this all up so you can just up and leave the moment you’re capable of it. Stay for the full experience.”

“I’m worried about how much this will cost.”

“Why? Surely your life has enough value to let people help you.”

“In exchange for what?” Stem challenges.

“We haven’t decided yet. Frankly there’s been no talk of fees or payment. Just help.”

“That doesn’t make sense.”

“It doesn’t have to make sense for it to help you. Besides. It’s not like the Floric make a whole lot of sense. Half mammal half plant? What? What insane creator deity decided THAT was the way to go?” Private Stream asks and Stem lets out a huff.

“Alright. Let me just chekc on Vine and the family body, then I’ll lay back down. Also fair warning, if you try and force some huge debt on me or use me or my family for experiments then I will fight back.”

“Good to know, glad to hear we have another reason to not do anything like that beyond it being a supremely evil and pointlessly antagonistic thing to do.” Private Stream says and Stem starts to rise up and Hooktail offers a claw for her to help herself up and she levers herself up with a slight, audible snapping sound as she breaks off the tiny feeler roots that had been growing into the earth in search of nutrients.

“Is that healthy?” Hooktail asks.

“What?” She asks.

“You just broke off a bunch of tiny roots right? Is that healthy?”

“It’s fine. Usually it’s the sign of a good night’s sleep.” Stem says as she rises fully with his help and takes a step over to look down at Vine’s head. “Damn. I’m going to need to teleport that entire chunk of earth into the Sky Garden. She’s putting down serious roots.”

“You can tell at a glance?”

“Use more than your eyes Young Andinus. Or at least, learn to sense Axiom without the mental shortcut of sight or sound. You’ll notice more.” Stem says as she puts the back of a knuckle against Vine’s head nad feels it. “She’s regaining hardness good and quick. The purging is happening fast.”

She then steps over and begins examining the body before letting out a huff. “This is going to be a big one. The body will need some trimming afterwards, otherwise we’re going to end up with something starting to get into the larger scale of the galaxy.”

“What?” Hooktail asks and Stem glances over at him before mulling it over. Then shrugging.

“We’re plants. We don’t age past maturity. However... we also respond differently to damage. It makes us stronger. Tougher. So long as we survive the blow, we grow more resilient. It’s why we’re rarely in hospitals or going for medical help. We don’t need it. Usually. Even limbs can be regrown, or specially grown and pruned limbs can be spliced onto the body.”

She then reaches down and taps the shoulder a few times. “This girl has been growing into a denser and denser hardwood for decades now. With this attack? It’s going to be the singlemost massive surge in power for the body. I’m not sure what’s going to happen. But... Petal here is going to be a very hard to control little girl. When her head grows in and she starts developing a personality at any rate.”

“Oh uh, something else you should know.” Hooktail begins.

“What is it?’ Stem asks.

“We’ve been trying to backtrack the viruses in your system. There may be a case for suing the people responsible for them. Do you want in on that?”

“Why?”

“Well, without you we can still get them as their viruses hit us and our systems after we accessed your ship. Reckless endangerment, attempted murder, perhaps more due to how much harm it caused. To say nothing of the fact that multiple companies deliberately sold tainted product to law abiding citizens.”

“Won’t work. Few judges or juries are sympathetic to the Floric. Even if laws are broken, we’re always considered the perpetrator, not the victim.”

“So you’re just going to roll over and take it?” Private Stream asks and she turns to face him.

“And what do you suggest I do? Hmm? Throw myself to the unfeeling, uncaring and empowered others who would sooner see me set on fire and used to fertilize their gardens then give me the time of day?”

“You were nowhere near this bitter before.”

“I was nearly dead before and out of options. Now I’ve got some health back. I’m not stupid. WE don’t have anyone on our side and... and... and you’re not acting the part. It’s not adding up and I don’t know why. And it’s really putting my back up.”

“The Undaunted are founded by and shaped by humans. Maybe creatures out of Cruel Space act a little different than what you’re expecting?” Private Stream asks.

“Yeah, it was a big part of their training in tactical that it really doesn’t matter what we think of one species or another. We have standards for how we treat them. Frankly, this is pretty par for the course. They can’t get a better person to help you, so they’re doing it themselves and figuring out how to make it profitable later.” Hooktail says with a shrug.

“Really?”

“It was near literally beaten into me. Also a weird lesson on hate.”

“Hate?”

“If you’re going to hate someone, then you’ll get a lot further by hating them for things they’ve done and not what was done to them.” Hooktail says.

“The fuck kind of basic did you go to?”

“Instructor Veers. He used the example of Axiom Effects being used to control others and the people controlled being the victims and not the perpetrators even if they’re the ones covered in blood. He also showed off images of bio-engineered monsters and explained that if you’re going to hate someone, hate the person who made the monster and not the monster itself. That pity is more reasonable. I don’t know it was some kind of morality lesson that was trying not to touch faith or law. So...” He shrugs.

1nznzk6,all,AITA for laughing and telling my friend that it was pretty funny that her friend got arrested.,"I (27M) was talking to one of my friends let's call her Katie and she was telling me about how she was very worried for her friend Giulla who called her worried because she got arrested in Japan and was embarrassed.

She is a somewhat mid sized twitch streamer and was with another streamer at a car meet-up. She got in the driver seat when the car was parked and the other streamer was away and when she came back she persuaded her to move the car and for some reason she had a brain fart, thought the car was in reverse, accelerated when she noticed it moving in reverse and forgot she had just changed it in drive and crashed. She hit someone but he dodged and wasn't injured but caused damage to 2 other cars.

The stream was still running and even though she deleted it someone captured it and reshared.

She also did not have an international driving permit necessary to drive in Japan and was arrested because that counts as unlicensed. She will now probably have to pay for the damages.

When Katie told me this and I saw the video, I laughed a lot and said that was hilarious. Like what a dumb thing to do. People were piling on her in the comments and I agreed with them. It was a small automatic car, like how stupid you have to be to mess that up.

My friend got upset and called me an asshole and claimed I was being misogynistic when I never even said anything about that.

She knows Guilia better than I do admittedly and said that she is a very sweet person and it must terrify her getting arrested and she did not want to drive it but gave in to peer pressure and that it could happen to anyone and has more to do with not having driven the car before and that if she had practiced like 10 minutes in a more open lot to get the feel of RHD and the car she would have been fine.

Now I'm wondering whether I was an ah for laughing, however what I said and my reaction was pretty similar to the majority of commentators in the video so I feel like I might be right over Katie.

AITA here?
 
At the same time I do find it funny given Guilia's track record. She has claimed in the past to be a car enthusiast yet can't drive. Similarly she also claims to be into data science, programming and wanting to learn about machine learning yet I checked her github and it only has basic stats stuff in R and not any substantial projects.

1o4upmh,all,Please don't take OPHTHALMOLOGY branch.,"I am the first doctor in my family, and I completed the entirety of my education in government - meaning that i received a subsidised education.

I had a good rank in the NEET PG Exam - 1.5k and i chose to take Ophthalmology at a premier institute for MS. My assumptions were that it was a chill branch, an end branch, less stress involved compared to other branches and so on.  (This was a major mistake on my part, as I would have gotten a non surgical branch in periphery, but i chose a city and college over the branch)

I was suffering from depression at that period in my life and hence i assume in retrospect that my decision making was compromised.

Nothing could have prepared me for the challenges that lie in ophthalmology, which I am going to list out for you, so that you don't make the same mistakes I did.

1. Even the best colleges aren't giving adequate training in cataract surgery (phacoemulsification). Meaning every year, thousands of untrained ophthalmologists are being churned out by medical colleges. Some of these people don't even know pterygium or SICS surgery- core basics

2. Fellowships in ophthal are two- long term or short term. Long term is for 2-3 years, pay is around 30k and workhours are 10h everyday. Short term means that you have to pay for the cases and you get limited cases. For instance SICS surgery you may get 20-30 cases for 50k, Phaco 15 cases for 1 lakh... and so on. 

3. Instrument and machine costs are incredibly high and it is impossible for own setup in a tier 1 city and if you have no financially backing. Jobs are less and pay is pathetic compared to our co-s in other branches, saturation is real, don't believe anyone who tells you there is no saturation. IT EXISTS. 

4. Learning curve is incredibly steep and the field has had major advancements in the last two decades. Cornea, Retina, Glaucoma, Oculoplasty have all become subspecialisations and ophtho certainly is not an end branch anymore  


The only saving grace for me is that I love my field and I love operating, somehow i seem to have a natural flair for the surgeries, and hence I have picked up things faster than others. I was well versed in phaco during residency, did anterior vitrectomies, DCRs, multiple corneal tear repairs.. Also did 1 trabeculectomy and sutures for squint- something that my other coworkers were not permitted to do. God's blessing of a good surgical hand is the ONLY reason I am not yet depressed again.

John sighed, looking out the window overlooking the hot springs out back. The rain had begun to pick up, and he could still catch the echoes of the crowd, Yuki's speech distinct, but unintelligible over the low roar. Yet, he didn't need to hear the words to know what she was doing.

The kitsune was making it clear this was an emergency, and gathering immense political capital without having to declare herself the leader. After all, who would say no to the kitsune who had just rid them of tax collectors, especially when she said there was a lurking threat? The priests probably had some sort of sway over the population, and if what he heard about this ""Grand Bargain"" was true, they'd have objections to her seizing power over mortals. Yet, it'd be borderline suicidal to make any open moves.

They had powers, sure, but they weren't as far above the average person as an Unbound seemed to be, if Rin was any indication, and there didn't seem to be that many of them. If they *did* try something, they'd likely get no support from the greater populace, so it'd be just them.

Of course, he'd prefer things not to come to that, but he was realistic. There was a chance they'd have to *dissuade* them somehow, although he was hopeful he could do it softly.

The most dangerous thing they could do was escape and alert someone with actual power of the situation, but it'd be deadly for them, too, even if Kiku let them go. After all, if it got out that they were assisting the Nameless after the ensuing crackdown, he didn't doubt that there would be consequences that would make whatever he could do look like a light lecture in comparison.

After all, this is a world where you can tear somebody's soul out of their body. He could only imagine the horrors one could inflict when sufficiently motivated.

A gentle knock on the door's frame drew his attention.

Yuki was still giving a speech. Rin would likely verbally announce herself or just barrel in. That only left one person who might be there.

""Come in,"" John said after twisting away from the window and ensuring he had a proper offensive focus in his gauntlet.

Segawa Yosuke walked through the door. He still bore an uncomfortable scent of decay, but he looked… different.  Yosuke's previously threadbare and torn clothes had been replaced with a simple, fresh working outfit. Indeed, the smell wasn't as strong as it once was, either, now far more tolerable. Although he still looked a bit like a mottled, melted candle with an array of swords stuck through his obscured skull, it was clear that a layer of grime John hadn't previously noticed was gone, with how much brighter his flesh was coloured.

In one of his hands was a wax tablet, held out for him to read, and in the other a small wooden rod to act as a pen for the soft surface.

""Lord Hall, thank you for your kindness. I will not be quick to forget it,"" read the text, the characters perhaps a bit rough, but precise and extremely legible.

""It's no problem, Yosuke. I might have done something earlier if I were aware of your situation. I wouldn't wish the existence of some trinket that can control one's actions on anyone,"" John commented, second-guessing his thoughts only a moment later. That was probably too informal, wasn't it? Shit, maybe he should have been more cautious, and that was perhaps too sore of a spot, too.

Although if there was anyone new that he could be a *bit* more relaxed around, wouldn't it be this guy? As screwed as the situation was, Yuki had control of him to a disturbing degree, even if it felt a bit too much like having a slave to him.

The man tilted his head, his lack of expression making him impossible to read as he wrote another message in a strange inversion of John's situation not too long ago. In a way, they were kindred spirits; two people torn from society and put in a place where they had no voice, even if John was on the mend now.

Perhaps he could rig up some sort of device to let him speak in the long run, if he sticks around after John finds a way to break whatever damned curse makes him need orders to live.

""Indeed?"" he wrote. ""My compliments to your parents, then. Here, all it took was one heavens-damned war for everyone's brains to turn to wet slop and start dripping out their noses.""

He chuckled a bit before he could stop himself. Abashed, he muttered, ""Sorry, sorry. That was just a bit… unexpected. In private, you can call me John, at the very least. I'm not big on formality.""

Yosuke nodded sharply, writing once more. ""They took the other two favourite pastimes of soldiers from me—drinking and whoring—so humour is all I have left. Well, and haikus. I fucking hate haikus.""

It took a moment for John to center himself and not to laugh at the absurdity of it, and his thoughts momentarily went to some of his disastrous attempts at haikus back in high school during a brief but potent *phase* that he insisted, as all teenagers do, wasn't one.

*A sun going down / beautiful scintillating / mist upon new dusk.*

Never again.

To be honest, he felt like he should be freaking out about the whole absurdity of the candle man under his kinda employ casually writing about going out for booze and prostitutes, but the sheer absurdity of the situation made it feel less tangible.

""You know what? Fair,"" he replied, sighing. ""No gambling?""

""I mean, if you wanted to get flogged, sure,"" he wrote with a grunt that sounded awfully wet. ""The officers always hated that shit. Dice out on deployment would get you digging latrines for months. On leave maybe, but most of the underground dens just used rigged bullshit to rob you anyway, so I saved my money for when I knew I'd get something out of it.""

Yosuke paused, scratching where his chin might be. ""You'd think that those idiots would catch on, but there seems to be nothing more appealing for soldiers with fresh pay than getting scammed out of their money and getting so mad that the hired muscle throws them into the streets.""

John clicked his tongue. ""Yeah, that makes sense. I think back home, they gave up and just let them do it as long as they aren't on duty or on base. There's always some place to blow their money stupidly nearby, though. I think I read something that said problem gambling is about three times more common amongst soldiers? Maybe it comes with being willing to risk your life for your country to begin with. A lot of folks are in there for the benefits and see the risk of dying as worth it, after all.""

The following snort was a bit ugly, due to the whole… no nose thing Yosuke had going on. John honestly wasn't even sure *how* he made that noise, but he was just rolling with the situation at this point.

""How about Shogi? You any good at that?"" John asked.

""Awful,"" Yosuke replied on the slate.

""Good,"" John replied, pulling the same hastily carved board and pieces Yuki made earlier from his bag, ""because I just started earlier this week. How about a game?""

There was a moment of silence as the man wrote his reply. ""Sure. You brought a board with you to a fight?""

John looked away, but only for a moment. ""The bag was mostly prepacked,"" he stated. ""I just forgot it was in there before now.""

There was no more conversation between them as they arranged the pieces. The pawn toss went to Yosuuke, and John internally sighed in relief. He definitely had a much easier time responding to a move than dealing with a choice paralysis inducing opening, so it was a small mercy.

The game went… not very well, but that was more or less what he expected. At some point, the roar of the crowd faded, but Yuki had yet to find him, although he had no doubt she somehow knew where he was thanks to her incredibly sharp sense. For now, he was in no hurry.

Even if he was getting absolutely demolished like a small hut in a hurricane by someone who stated they were ""awful"" at shogi.

John stared at the positively abysmal board state that even he could tell was a wholesale slaughter, trying to figure out how the hell it even got to that point. Maybe he could still pull it back?

Hesitantly, he made his next move, sliding his lance two spaces forward, blocking Yosuke's angle mover from taking his gold general.

The sound of tapping drew his attention, and he glanced up to see another message written on the wax slate.

""You weren't lying when you said you sucked,"" it read.

John grunted coarsely. ""Well, excuse me for sucking at a game I'm just learning. You're awfully confident, beating one of your bosses this badly on your first day.""

Yosuke shrugged. ""I died once already, so it's a lot harder to get properly scared of something. Besides, I want to help my country in some small way, and if you killed me again for something *that* minor, odds are you weren't going to do anything with me to begin with.""

""Damn,"" John said. ""I can't argue with that logic."" Internally, he cursed as Yosuke made another move that put him even further in the corner. ""In any case, I can't promise you we'll be going out to fight evil or the… invaders or anything."" Not that he knew anything about them, and to be honest, he was kind of worried about asking. They came from the south, and if he remembered correctly, and this world's layout was anything like his home's, that would put them by coming from either… Taiwan, the Philippines, the Indonesian Archipelago, or *maybe* China, depending on the angle of approach and how it was divided up in this era.

To be honest, given how messy things were with the new world crops kicking around, he wouldn't be surprised if it was somehow crusaders down there causing a ruckus.

""That's fine,"" Yosuke replied. ""Purging an infestation of monsters and killing some dipshit corrupt officials is plenty to keep me happy for quite a while. I've not lived a life where I'll be one of the few to rise to the heavens above on moral merit, and I wasn't an Unbound, so I can't go there from strength alone, but this might earn me a comfortable spot in the underworld.""

And there was another bombshell for him to deal with. He wasn't sure how much of that was myth and how much was fact. He did not doubt the matter of Unbound being able to *ascend* to the heavens in some manner, but it was his understanding that there were no great and powerful deities around like there once were. That meant if the afterlife was sorting people somehow, it either could automatically do it, or it was being *run* by a third party somehow.

Does that mean that the afterlife is subject to bureaucracy and politics? What the hell would happen to *him* after he died? Yuki seemed to think he had some sort of Presence, which was an extension of the soul, so presumably he had some kind of soul as the locals understood it, at least to a degree. Oh fuck, he hoped he wasn't so different that he would get stuck in some grand celestial machine and have to be unstuck like a grease clog in a pipe.

Well, he'd just have to try his best not to die, then—just the same as usual.

Shaking off that bit of newly discovered existential dread, he made another move, refocusing on the game.

""Fair enough, I guess,"" he muttered, sliding his silver general to the side.

For a few minutes, they played in silence.

And then the door slid open *enthusiastically,* the slide squeaking like a surprised mouse.

""Sensei!"" boomed Rin as she entered the room, bouncing on her heels as she came to a stop. ""Yuki has finished up with the villagers and has started interrogating the captives, and she sent me to you to see if you needed anything!""

Seemingly actually beholding the scene for the first time, she froze, staring at the board. Her eyes hurriedly scanned over John, the board, and Yosuke, although he noted a hint of something dark when her gaze passed over the undead.

""Hey there, Rin, I'm fine. Yosuke and I were just passing the time. There's not much I can do until I'm back at the fort,"" John commented. He really hoped she didn't have some problem with the guy; he could only imagine how much trouble the scale-bearing Unbound could get up to if she decided she wanted to cause some issues. The thought of how dramatic she could be mixed with the pouting of a teenager going on forty-plus and the ability to bench press a small car was positively horrifying and something he'd only wish on phone scammers that call you at six in the morning and maybe people who don't return their shopping carts.

""Would you mind if I joined you two?"" Rin asked, although her eyes were pointedly locked onto him rather than Yosuke.

Whatever that was, he was going to avoid engaging with it the same way one would avoid a field of landmines.

He looked across to Yosuke, but the undead offered no answer of his own, placidly sitting in place, although John couldn't tell whether he was looking at him, Rin, or the board, given the lack of eyes.

Say, how *did* Yosuke see?

It wasn't as if he was smelling things, as he had no context for how these tiles would smell, nor was he navigating by hearing. He was able to set up his half of the board easily, and John didn't see the man rubbing his fingers over the tiles to try to feel what the characters were. Yet, he clearly could perceive them.

He was shaken from his thoughts by Rin settling next to him, surprisingly. She wasn't too close to his side, but she certainly made herself *present,* kneeling next to him as she was. She said nothing, but kept her eyes on the board like a hawk as she settled. The game resumed, with Rin staying *suspiciously* silent.

It went on for a few more moves, and he went to move his jewelled general before he suddenly jolted, a bit of static against his ankle shaking him from his thoughts. 

Hmm.

Looking at what he was going to do again, that would have opened him up to an angle mover putting him in check. Instead, he slid his flying chariot to the side.

The game went on, although there was something about the mats that kept on zapping him! He swore it hadn't happened before, but…

He turned his gaze to Rin, who was looking straight at the board, almost *too* focused, like she was pointedly trying not to look at him.

*Hmm.*

Testingly, he reached for his lance, going to make a move which was obviously self-destructive.

Sure enough, a little bit of static electricity zapped him again, Rin's tail twitching against the mat they were sitting on.

John wasn't sure whether he should be annoyed or bemused. On one hand, Rin seemed to think he was beyond help, and he was a bit miffed at her helping him cheat without consent via electric shocks, like some insane chess scandal that you found a video essay on several decades later.

On the other hand, her gloomy attitude now made a lot more sense: she was salty about her sensei getting his ass kicked by some random person who she didn't know in shogi, and that was positively *hilarious.*

""Oh!"" John exclaimed, suddenly standing up while keeping a straight face. ""I'll be back in a second, Yosuke. I need to take care of something. Rin, mind accompanying me?""

""Of course, sensei!"" she replied, sunnily springing to he feet to follow him.

Yosuke nodded and didn't rise as the duo left the room.

""What do you need, sensei?"" Rin asked after he slid the door shut, but he said nothing, leading her down stairs, out toward the back door.

""Oh, I was just thinking about what has to get done around here. Do you know anything about warehousing work?"" John asked, sliding the door to the back lot open.

Hesitantly, Rin shook her head. ""No, sensei,"" she answered, glancing at the various half-deconstructed tents, boxes piled under and outside them. Some were packed with supplies, others with clothes, and some with trade goods.

""Eh, you count your supplies before a journey, it's close enough,"" he commented, pulling some writing supplies from a pocket and shoving them into her arms, which she hurriedly caught. ""I'd like an inventory of what's back here so we can redistribute it to the villagers later. Good luck!"" At that, he patted her on the shoulder twice and turned to leave.

""Sensei?!"" she called after him.

He glanced over his shoulder at the woman. ""Rin. Come on now,"" he drawled, sighing. ""Is loss not the first step to skill? Would you deny me my learning experience? Oh, and I'll take a one-page essay on what *hydrogen* and *oxygen* mean to you when you're done.""

As she blushed and sputtered, he slid the door shut with an audible thunk behind him, strutting away, making sure to make some distance before cackling privately to himself. From there, it was an easy trip back to their impromptu gaming room, and before he settled back down, he made sure to check on Rin through the open window, making sure all was going well.

""Kids, right?"" Yosuke wrote on his slate. ""She has a lot of growing to do.""

John chuckled, the manner of Rin's age coming to mind. ""A bit,"" he responded, ""You almost have to admire it, though. It's impressive she's managed to stay like that, despite the world. Not as if she's that sheltered, either.""

Ultimately, John lost that match and the next one, too, but it was a fun experience, made all the better by watching Rin trying to figure out how to sort fishing poles out back.",SteelTrim,2025-10-08 05:31:05,380,0.99,25,405,text,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,/r/HFY/comments/1o0vj5s/engineering_magic_and_kitsune_ch_47/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o0vj5s/engineering_magic_and_kitsune_ch_47/,self.HFY,0,OC,Human,0,none,"[""https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gvt665/engineering_magic_and_kitsune/)"", ""https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nuyyk3/engineering_magic_and_kitsune_ch_46/)"", ""https://www.patreon.com/posts/engineering-and-139592291)""]",17431,38,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,
1nzog8u,all,"The gym is for everyone, not just for your solo session.","I've been going to the gym for a while and what i observed is some people, mostly girls (especially who started working out recently) need to learn some etiquettes.Machines/benches/equipments are meant to be shared. Happed to me so many times that I I've started becoming passive aggressive about it.

Incident 1: On push day I went and checked if anyone is using the bench, a girl is using it so I just stayed back waiting till she's done. Usually I just ask to share it but I don't want to be seen as someone trying to hit on her so I stayed back. She's doing a set taking rest for 5min or more checking phone/ waiting for her PT in between sets.I waited for 15min or so and few sets later she's still not done so I just went up to her and said can I do a set? She said she's using it. Mind you shes sitting next to a bench on her phone for 5 mins.I just told her we can alternate and started adjusting bench,she gave me a look of disgust.

Incident 2: Some aunty was using the chest press machine. Her PT went away to train someone else and was sitting there for 10 mins doing nothing   so i went up and asked do you mind if we share the machine. I kid you not she just ignored me, started looking for her trainer. She did not speak a word to me and didn't even move. I just walked away.

Incident 3: A girl is doing shoulder press on machine. She's all alone doing her set and taking rest in between. I usually don't like to go up of there are two or more persons but as she's alone so I went up and asked how many sets left. She said 4 sets left. I asked if we can alternate? She told me she's working out. She did not want to share the machine. Like what??

These are just few incidents. Guys if you're done with your set move aside there might be someone else who wants to use the machine. Or if someone asks to share the machine during your rest time do not say I'm using it. Let them use it too.
Also don't just hop on machine and start working, ask the nearby person if they are using it and if they don't mind sharing it.Gym is a shared space and act like it.

1o2c6kp,all,We need to talk about that video Hank endorsed,"So [two days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/s/nmRBhYvwwe) there was a bit of a kerfuffle around whether Hank did or didn’t say something that was being used in the thumbnail of a video about that time Grok got really into Hitler. He confirmed that the quote from him was real there and the issue was smoothed out. Problem solved, right? 

Well, not exactly. I have some issues with that video, and I’m worried Hank and nerdfighters in general aren’t informed about the network of people associated with it and some harmful things they believe and do. 

The first two thirds of the video I have very little issue with, it does thorough coverage of how Grok has repeatedly done stuff xAI engineers were clearly not able to anticipate or prevent. The last third is worrying. It has a lot of AI doomerism, followed by a call to action involving a nonprofit called 80,000 hours. 

80,000 hours is a career advice nonprofit focused on telling people how best to spend their lives to have a positive impact on society at large. It’s an Effective Altruist charity, and its opinions about what careers are good is largely filtered through that lens. 

Effective Altruism is a movement that describes itself as applying scientific reasoning and data driven logic to utilitarian moral good. Basically “if donating a dollar to this charity would do one unit of good, but donating a dollar to this other charity would do two units of good, I should donate to the second charity.” 

On its face this sounds good. Arguably, Effective Altruists would really like the Maternal Center of Excellence. There are three major problems though. 

First, a lot of Effective Altruist belief is centered around “earning to give”. That phrase is a line of EA advice that says “doing moral good in a career in politics or most research or working for an ordinary charity is hard, and you probably aren’t going to do much better than the person who would take that job in your place, it’s better to take a morally neutral job that makes a lot of money like a stock broker and donate more money to charity.” 

That’s important because Sam Bankman Fried was a major donor to 80,000 hours. He got into quantitative trading and eventually crypto exchange management after being recruited into Effective Altruism by William MacAskill, one of its founders. Arguably, one of SBF’s reasons for defrauding regular people for billions of dollars was to have more money to donate to Effective Altruist causes.   

This video is also very well produced. It had a 3 day shoot in a rented San Francisco office building, dedicated props, and a seven person crew. Presumably that means that 80,000 hours put a decent chunk of funding into this, and that means they see it as an effective way to promote themselves. 

Second, it favors charities whose impact is immediately measurable and who can make immediate claims, and it does so in a way that pits charities against one another. Buying malaria netting lets you claim an immediate life saved very cheaply, where testing a novel medication for a rare form of childhood cancer costs much more money and might require significant statistical analysis to prove that it’s correlated with a 5% better chance of remission. Both are important. 

Third, it favors charities that hypothetically have an unbounded amount of positive impact, particularly the ones that appeal to Effective Altruists as a group. EAs are largely tech and sci fi focused white collar people in computer science fields, so things like preventing extinction events through space colonization and AI research in particular receive outsized amounts of attention. 

AI research in particular is important because Effective Altruism and its ideological cousin Rationalism have increasingly become focused to a fault on threats of superintelligent AI. For EA, the reasoning is pretty simple: “if AI takes over and it’s nice then all life will be amazing forever, but if it takes over and it’s evil then either we all die or it tortures us forever.” Rather than children’s cancer research having to compete with African malaria netting for deserving donations, both of them have to compete against an infinite number of hypothetical future people. 

If this sounds like these people found a roundabout way to have heaven and hell in a seemingly scientific movement, it’s because they have. Worse, they reinvented Pascal’s Wager but this time with real people’s actual money. 

And at this point it’s important to point out that a lot of the AI specific research that Effective Altruists care about are specifically Effective Altruist AI researchers. A good example of this is Eliezer Yudkowsky, founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. Yudkowsky has no formal education past middle school. His qualifications for AI research are “blogger with opinions tech CEOs like.” His most notable claim to fame is that the Harry Potter fanfic he wrote lead to a pickup line Elon Musk used to start dating Grimes. 

If you peel back a layer on most of things in this side of the Effective Altruist and Rationalist space you find un or under qualified people arguing for things way outside of their domain knowledge. For another example, Slate Star Codex, a rationalist blog by a psychiatrist in San Francisco, has platformed human biodiversity repeatedly. For those not in the know, human biodiversity is *rebranded eugenics and race science*. 

Also, and I cannot stress this enough, I haven’t talked about the death cult yet. 

The Zizians are a rationalist and effective altruist associated cult-like loose group of people credibly associated with six murders. Their leader, Ziz LaSota, was in the Effective Altruists space before and during her spiral into cult leadership. In my opinion, the cultural environment in Effective Altruism meaningfully contributed to this. 

Effective Altruism explicitly targets neurodiverse people. William MacAskill is directly quoted as saying “The demographics of who this appeals to are the demographics of a physics PhD program. The levels of autism ten times the average. Lots of people on the spectrum.” It seems like if a person explicitly targets neurodiverse people they should hold themselves responsible for the risks from how their recruiting might be harmful to those people. 

Effective Altruist meetups also have some features that are kind of cultic in nature. To be clear I don’t mean mainline Effective Altruism is a cult, just that they have practices that can put you in a malleable mind state like cults often do. Sleep deprivation, love bombing, group conversations where everyone exposes emotionally vulnerable things about themselves, psychedelic drug use during the previous things, etc. Arguably something like an anime convention is cultic in this way though, so take that with a grain of salt. 

Still, it was at one of these meetups that Ziz, a trans, likely neurodiverse, broke grad student was taken aside by a more senior Effective Altruist and told she was likely going to be a net negative on the risk of an evil self aware AI. In essence, she was told that she was going to help cause AI hell. In and around this conversation they talked about whether some effective altruists most rational plan to help the future was to buy expensive life insurance and commit suicide. Also, she was told to take a regimen of psychoactive drugs by this person in order to “maybe make me not bad for the world.”

I don’t really have a good conclusion to make here. I feel like these groups aren’t great, are set up in a very pipeline-y way, and that nerdfighters being even indirectly pointed in the direction of these spaces is bad.

1o0cp88,all,Just put the baby down,"Hi guys,

FTM here. So my baby just turned 10 weeks old, and I thought I’d share my experience. For the first four weeks of his life, he just wanted to be held all the time. He hated being put down, wouldn’t sleep unless he was in someone’s arms, and honestly it was ruining my quality of life. I wasn’t getting any sleep, neither was my partner, and I started getting nerve pain in my hands from holding him so much.

Every time my mum or mother-in-law came over, they’d say things like “Oh wow, the baby loves being held,” and then they’d add, “You’re creating a monster, you need to start putting him down.” At first, I’d get a bit offended, because I was already exhausted and trying my best. But deep down, I knew I wasn’t enjoying myself. I needed to be able to shower, cook, and just function, and I couldn’t do that if I was holding him 24/7.

So I started doing some research on early conditioning, basically helping newborns get used to having their needs met even when they’re not being held. Both my mum and mother-in-law said they did it with their kids, and since they both had big families, they kind of had no choice.

The first two days were really hard. He fussed every time I put him down. My mother-in-law showed me this little method she used: pick him up when he fussed, soothe him with a dummy, and then put him back down. When he fusses again, pick him up, calm him down, and put him back down. It felt like a constant back and forth, like a cat and mouse game, and it was exhausting. Sometimes I’d give in and just hold him, but I kept reminding myself why I was doing it.

By the third day, things started to change. When I put him down, he’d actually stay there, happy and awake. My mother-in-law also told me to hold his hand when he fusses and let his little fingers wrap around mine, and that helped a lot.

By five weeks, he was happy lying on his back, and that made it possible to start sleep training. By week six, he was sleeping seven hours straight, and now at 10 weeks he sleeps around eight to nine hours a night, with one wake-up around 5am after going to bed at 9pm.

My quality of life has improved so much. He’s comfortable and content, and now he actually loves being on his back. It’s funny because sometimes when we pick him up and we’re not feeding him, he’ll fuss until we put him back down so he can look around.

I just wanted to share my experience because I know how tough those early weeks can be. It took patience and persistence, but it’s been so worth it. It’s easy to get offended when people give advice, but once I stopped taking it personally and focused on what I wanted for me and my baby, things really started to get better.

Anyway, that’s my little success story. I’m finally enjoying motherhood, and my baby is happy too. ❤️

——

Update, just adding things we did:

We never had to use the cry it out method. I would pick him up as soon as he started fussing, and put him down once he was calmer.

9am wake up. Bright/natural life to help him get used to day/night.

Tummy time: helps to tire him out whilst also learning how to lift up his neck.

Shorter/consistent naps during the day. I wouldn’t let him sleep longer than an hour and a half. 

Bath time every night. And then we read to him afterwards. 

Massages after to relieve gas. Helps a ton. When baby is comfortable, he’s sleeps wayyy more.

Blackout windows/white noise machine.

For the people that are implying that he’s neglected… we tried a very long time to conceive. He is loved to the moon and stars ❤️ (and he sleeps yay!)

So based on all the math information it knows it can make new math concepts to solve some of the most challenging problem to help us live a better evolving life.

**Memory transcription subject: Kaplan, Venlil Student**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 7th, 2137*

\++++++++++

“Alright, now Keii,” said Principal Pachri, staring over her glasses. “Why don't you tell me in your own words what happened?”

The trembling Sivkit in the chair next to me flicked an ear with a bit of hesitation. She couldn’t even look at me. The coward.

“I-I was just talking with my friends in the hallway, and then Kaplan came up and he… h-he hit me.”

My ears pinned back even harder against my head, as I stared at a spot on the ground off to the side. She was leaving out the part where she called my orangish black-striped coat weird and ugly first. But it wasn’t like the context mattered.

Our Farsul principal turned her gaze to me. “Kaplan? Did you hit her?”

“Why bother asking?” I sneered. “Everyone saw it.”

Pachri stared at me for a while, maybe hoping for some kind of reaction. I didn't give her one. Eventually, she let out a little sigh through her nose. 

“Keii, could you step out into the hallway, please?” she requested. 

The Sivkit readily flicked an ear and hopped out of the chair, quickly taking the offered fruit to get away from me. She stepped outside with only a brief glance my way and shut the door behind her. 

For a few moments, Pachri didn't say anything. She just looked at me, her eyes searching like she was trying to figure out what she could even say to a reject like me. The only sound was the ticking of an old antique clock hanging on the wall.

“Why did you hit her?” she asked quietly.

“...What does it matter?” I replied, still staring at that spot on the floor.

“Kaplan–”

“What? It doesn't.” I curled up a bit tighter. “You don't have to act like you care. Just punish me and get it over with.”

“Do you *want* to be punished?”

I didn't reply. There was no point. But Pachri still looked at me with her ears drooping like she was *concerned.*

“Kaplan… I truly am worried about you, you know?” she lied. “I'm so certain that you're capable of great things. But all this predatory behavior… this is the second time this academic cycle you've been dragged in here over something like this, not to mention dozens of other lesser rule violations. By the ancestors, you already have a record with the guild at only fourteen. And I can only protect you from them so much.”

I just sharply whipped my tail. “So then don't. It's not your problem.”

“No, it isn’t my problem. It's my *responsibility.* I have a responsibility to all of you, to make sure you all bloom from little seedlings into beautiful, well-tended flowers. But you only have a few passes left until graduation, and yet you seem entirely hell-bent on destroying any chance you have of a successful future. I don't want to see that from any student.”

I didn’t respond, so she continued. “Don’t you… have any plans after school? To go to university? Or some dream?”

“No.”

“Truly? Nothing at all?”

I glanced up at her. Her features… they seemed genuine. Like she really *was* concerned.

It just made me angrier.

So I turned back to that spot on the floor. “It doesn’t matter,” I said.

She held her gaze on my own inattentive face for a moment longer, before sighing and rubbing her temples. 

“I want to help you, Kaplan. But since it’s quite clear you don't *want* any help… I'll just say you’re a very lucky Venlil. I was able to handle things internally the first time this happened, but a second violation would normally require me to have you scheduled for a predator disease screening by law. But with those facilities and laws changing of late, your punishment is now entirely at my discretion.”

Pachri turned towards the hologram projected by her docked pad and began to type. “I will be suspending you for two herds of paws. Any classwork you miss as a result of this punishment will be up to you to make up. I recommend you speak to your teachers before you leave to work out a plan. And of course, I will be informing your parents, and sending them an incident report along with the specifics of your punishment. Do you understand?”

“Yeah.”

She waved her snout towards the door. “Then you may go. And send Keii back in, would you?”

Wordlessly, I slid from the chair and started towards the door. But as I put my paw on the handle, Pachri called out to me from behind. 

“Kaplan…” she started, before pausing. I didn't turn to look at her.

“...I truly meant what I said, you know?” she eventually continued. “I really do think that you are capable of great things. But you have to want it. Just… be careful, okay?”

I paused there in the door for a moment, not sure what to say or feel. Without a word, I pushed the door open, motioned to Keii with my tail to go back inside, and trudged off down the hall.

\++++++++++

*Stupid Keii… stupid school… stupid… everything!* 

All that I'd managed to do on my way to my locker was get myself more worked up. Everyone in my path had noticed me coming and averted their eyes. Afraid of me. Shunning me. I heard my name whispered fearfully as they spotted me, along with mentions of predator disease and violence. Their respect brought me pleasure, but right now it also just pissed me off.

Cowards. All of them. So brahking pathetic. Why should I want respect from them?

My tail lashed behind me as I threw open my locker. “Stupid Pachri… *‘Oh, Kaplan, you should be thinking about your fuuuutuuuuuure…’”* I quietly muttered to myself in a high-pitched, mocking voice. I quickly grabbed my bag out of the messy locker and slammed it closed, loud enough to make the people nearby nearly jump out of their coats. “The BRAHK does she know?! She doesn't know me!”

As I stormed through the hall, I heard something in my bag rattle. I reached into a pocket and took out a plastic prescription bottle. Inside were a bunch of colorful pills; some kinda medicine that was supposed to suppress my predatory tendencies. I’d gotten it the first time I’d tested positive for predator disease. Normally I would’ve ended up in a facility, but my parents had hired a lawyer who’d negotiated the punishment down to this. I was on a strict routine: I had to take one at every waking. It was a heavy dose, too.

Of course, I hadn't taken them in a while. I knew I’d get in less trouble if I did what I was told, but I hated how these pills made me feel… or, not feel. They made everything muted and weird. I wouldn’t feel angry, but I also wouldn’t feel happy, or sad, or really anything at all. It was like drowning in a sea of wool that I couldn't find escape from no matter how hard I struggled. 

I stared at the bottle. Maybe I should start taking these again... But, well, I was already in trouble. It’d be like planting a tree on top of a sprout. 

Besides, I’d already embraced being a predator.

I stuffed the bottle back into my bag as I stepped outside. Turning and walking just around the corner to the side of the school building, I instead reached into another pocket. Inside were several tightly-rolled brezik leaves tied together with string, and a lighter. I pulled a roll from the bundle, stuck one end in my mouth, lit the other, and inhaled. Bitter smoke filled my airway, scratching my throat and drying my mouth. But as I exhaled, all the tension I'd been feeling for the past claw blew away along with it. I knew this wasn't a healthy solution to my temper either, for a lot of reasons; people told me the smoke smelled even nastier than it tasted and that I personally stank of it, not to mention the slow buildup of speh in my lungs. But at least brezik let me feel more like ME. I was still pissed off. Just… calmer.

I heard the end-of-school whistle behind me. A scratch later, pups from every grade, most younger than me, began to file out the door in big herds. Some of them I recognized, but I didn't say anything. I wasn’t their equal. I was *better* than them. And either way, right now, I wanted to be alone. Still, a few of the non-Venlil scrunched up their snouts as they passed. Did brezik really smell that bad? Well, not my problem.

As the big herds began to disperse, I watched from my hiding place as a few smaller ones lingered, talking about their plans for the rest of the paw or just having a good time now that school was out. Watching it just started to sour my mood all over again, but I didn’t have anything better to do. There was also a big… herd? Pack of Humans clustered together on the grass a little ways off the walkway, and everyone else was kinda keeping their distance.

One herd in particular—a black-coated Venlil, a Harchen, and one of those Humans, who all looked like they were maybe two grades below me—went over to the big brick-and-metal sign that displayed our school’s name and did something to the side of it. Pranksters, maybe? They talked between each other, the Venlil in particular looking excited about something, but I couldn’t make any of it out. Either way, eventually a shuttle van came for the Humans, the Venlil’s friend got in with the rest of them, and a moment later the Venlil and Harchen took off and split up in opposite directions at the entrance gate.

Soon, most of even the stragglers had dispersed, with only a small pawful of people still loitering around. Well, now what? I didn’t want to go home and get threshed more, but I also didn’t have anywhere else to be. Everyone being afraid of me felt great, but it also didn’t really leave me with anyone who I could herd up with after class.

With a smoky sigh, I eventually just decided to go home. My brezik roll was almost done, anyway. I pulled the last little bit into my mouth and bit down, only slightly burning my mouth but quickly releasing those last few bits of mood-altering chemicals for a quick shot of relaxation. My little break from the world finished, I emerged from my hiding spot and started towards the gate, taking an idly curious glance towards the entrance sign as I passed.

…

…What in the voids is this?

The herd from earlier had stuck a real, paper flyer on the side of the sign with tape. It looked like an ad, but there was also a Krakotl doing an impressive-looking kick? That alone drew a lot of attention, and my curiosity quickly won out and pulled me in for a closer look. The text, carefully placed to avoid the Krakotl’s leg, was written in both Venlang and… whatever the Human script was called.

**Starlit Hope MMA Gym**

*Learn to fight like a predator in these exterminator-approved courses!*

*Taught by a real Human instructor, these classes will introduce you to the world of combat sports in a safe, controlled environment. Exterminators are always available on-site to observe and quickly respond to any incidents.*

*First class free with no signup!*

*\*Paid for by the Starlight Grove Exterminator’s Guild. Warning: Humans will be unmasked.\**

…The brahk? This didn’t sound legal. I tore the flyer off and looked closer, but the second read-through was the same as the first. It even had the guild’s official logo right there in the bottom corner. In the other was a map and an address.

Maybe they meant fight like a predator, like, in a metaphorical kinda way? Wait, no, it says *combat sports.* I took out my pad and tried to look up the phrase, and immediately got hit with a bunch of predatory topic warnings. Those censors had been loosening lately, so anything that still had these warnings had to be REALLY bad. But as I clicked through them and began to read… my tail began to wag.

I still remembered the paw that the Humans first showed up. I got dragged into a bunker in the middle of my normal sleep claw. We were expecting a raid, but when we were given the all-clear and came out snout-to-snout with a brand new predator species, I remember feeling so excited.

It hadn’t taken long for them to integrate. Now those predators were everywhere, especially now that we had a bunch of refugees from the war. And in the solar passes since, the Humans…

Had been so brahking disappointing.

I was expecting them to take over everything. I wanted them to burn it all down. All the haters kept bleating that they were a danger to the herd, but so what? What had the herd ever done for me? And I’d *kinda* gotten what I wanted. The Humans really were changing a lot of stuff. But they were doing it in the most boring way possible. Sure, they were fighting the Federation and all, but I still had to go to school, and get yelled at about my future, and get in trouble with the exterminators, and all this other stupid speh. Only now I had to do it next to a bunch of masked predators that I’d quickly figured out wouldn’t even hurt a laysi. Brahk, some of these *vicious predators* were SCARED of laysi!

But THIS…

*So the predators were holding out on me.*

My ears shot wickedly high. I had no idea what a class like this would be like. The descriptions were simplified; probably censored even now to avoid anything *too* predatory, and the small pawful of pictures I could find probably didn’t really show the whole thing. But if I could fight… could *destroy* like a real predator… crush anyone that got in my way…

*No one would* ***ever*** *think to cross me.*

I knew right then and there I had to give it a try. The first class was free, so there was no reason not to. Besides, I was pretty naturally big and strong for a Venlil. I could probably handle anything they taught me easily. And if I died…

Well, so what? Not like there was anything for me here.

Taking the flyer with me, I went through the gate and headed right for the station.

  

\++++++++++

…The brahk is this?

In front of me was a big, undecorated plastic prefab frame that hadn’t even had its outer brickwork finished yet. In fact, a crew was working on it right now. A big part of the outside of the building was fenced off for safety. Above the door was a simple sign written in Venlang and that same blocky Human writing. “Starlit Hope MMA Gym,” just like in the ad. Sounded kinda cliché.

Was this place open? I double-checked the address on the now-crumpled flyer with my pad. Everything lined up, but…

I decided to just ask. There were some… surprisingly, unmasked Humans working on the other side of the fence, along with some other prey species. I knew those predators were actually hilariously soft, but seeing their forward-facing eyes did kinda tickle my brain the wrong way, so I tried to find someone else to ask. Eventually, a random Venlil worker came close enough that I could call out.

“Hey!” I brayed.

I was ignored. Or, he didn’t hear me. He was chiseling down a big stone into individual bricks. I actually didn’t know they still did that by paw… “HE-E-E-EY!” I bleated louder.

The Venlil’s ears perked before he glanced up at me. “H-Huh?” he gasped. The dude looked *exhausted.*

“Uh, hey, is this…” I jabbed my thumb towards the building. “Is this place open?”

“It is. S-Sorry about the mess…” He snatched up a bottle of water from the ground and chugged half of it. “Ugh, stars, these Humans are hard to keep up with…”

“And it’s uh… real?” I asked. “Like, they teach you how to fight like a predator here?”

“Th-That they do.” The Venlil let out an exhausted huff as he sat down on a small pile of white bricks he’d already made. His snout was more orange than an unripe stringfruit. “Y-You want to join?”

My ears pinned back. “That a problem?”

The man’s eyes narrowed back. “Are you with the guild?”

“Brahk no.”

“You’re just joining by yourself? As a civilian?”

“What’s with all the voids-damned questions? It’s none of your business!” I bleated, throwing my paws in the air.

But instead of replying or getting angry, the man… his tail began to wag, and he pumped his fist excitedly. Then he turned and called over his shoulder. “HEY AHMAD!” he bugled. “WE GOT A CIVVIE! FIFTY CREDITS, PAY UP!”

“What? Aw, fuck!” I heard someone respond from the far side of the construction site in a deep, growling voice.

*…Wait, what?*

The Venlil turned back to me, whistling to himself. “Sorry, sorry,” he said. “I wasn’t trying to pry. It’s just that about half the crew were convinced that only exterminators would show up for the first class this paw, and that everyone else would be too scared. I knew better, though.”

“Wait, how many exterminators are gonna be here?” I asked. “The ad made it sound like there’d just be one sitting around to watch the Humans.”

“Well, it’s sponsored by the guild for a reason. The agreement from the Humans was that they would teach the guild their tricks, but they also had to allow anyone to join.”

*Aw, brahk, I gotta take the class next to the torchers…? Can’t I get a brahking break?*

Speaking of which… I caught a flash of silver in the corner of my vision that pulled my attention. There was a whole squad—a Krakotl, a Gojid, and a suited-up Takkan without the helmet—walking towards the entrance. The first two looked pretty nervous already, but the last one seemed confident. They all glanced at me; the Takkan in particular paused and gave me that signature look of disdain I’d seen on so many of them before, like he was just as offended by my presence as I was of his.

“You should move along, pup,” said the Takkan. “This is not a place for children.”

My paws clenched into fists. *Asshole… I’m fourteen! I’m basically an adult!*

“I don’t remember asking for your opinion,” I butted back. “I’ll join if I want.”

“Oh? Another tainted civilian who wishes to learn to fight…” he said to the air with a lazy, casual amusement. Like I wasn’t even worth his time. “Well, then I wish you luck. For whenever we begin practicing on one another…” He took a step closer, and I suddenly found myself smothered by the bigger man’s shadow. “You may find yourself treading rough waters.”

Before I could reply, maybe by smashing my skull into his chest, he turned his back to me. “Kellic. Teska. Let’s go.”

“Y-Yes, sir…”

And so he ignored me and left, heading inside with his squad, and leaving me standing alone with all this rage and nothing to take it out on. *Nothing* pissed me off more than some asshole who acted like he was better than me. I already needed more brezik.

…Well, no. I *did* have something to take it out on. And it was waiting just inside.

The construction Venlil let his ears droop in worry as he looked towards the entrance the exterminators had just gone through. “...So much has happened in such a short time,” he muttered to himself before turning back to me. “Kid, I don’t know why you’re interested in this stuff and I won’t pry, but just be careful, alright? You’re gonna stick out from the herd if you try to antagonize the exterminators, and… well, you know how they treat people who stick out.”

“What’s with everyone telling me to *be careful* this paw?” I replied, my tail rapidly swaying back and forth with equal parts excitement and fury. “I’m gonna be learning how to hurt people, aren’t I? I don’t need to be careful. That guy wants a fight? *I’ll give him one.*”

The man looked at me with a touch of shock, before loosening up with a sigh. “My daughter’s really got her work cut out for her in there…” he said to himself, before pushing himself up off the pile of bricks onto his hindpaws. “Well, good luck with that, then. I gotta get back to work.”

He went back to his big stone, chisel in paw. I turned and stared up at the building. It was so… normal on the outside. But that was fine. I knew it was just a cover. The *real* carnage was on the inside.

I was about to experience the real predatory side of Humanity. And I couldn’t be more excited. 

Without any hesitation, I stepped up to the door and threw it open. I didn’t know what to expect. Maybe a bloodsoaked arena? Or racks of stained primitive weaponry like clubs or swords? Stars, either would be *great.*

Never in a million cycles would I have expected as I saw as I stepped inside.

“GIVE IT BACK!”

There was a small herd of a couple different species inside. Most looked to be older than me, and all of them had some exterminator gear. In fact, there was only one other person in here besides me who wasn’t an exterminator or a Human, and all of us had apparently come in to watch her chase one of the predators across a big padded room in some weird inversion of the natural order.

“Rika, come on!” she bleated. “Give me back my pad!”

“No way!” replied the Human. “How could you have kept these baby speep pics from me?! Oh, my god, you look like a little toasted marshmallow!”

“GIVE IT!”

“Ooh, I wanna see!” shouted another Human. A taller female, from what I could tell.

Immediately, Rika wound her arm back and threw the stolen pad over the Venlil’s head right at the taller one. All of the exterminators flinched at the motion. Her accuracy was admittedly kinda impressive, but…

My ears fell in disappointment. Between the big herd of exterminators and these three acting like clowns, this was already feeling like a waste of time. Should’ve known it’d be too good to be true.

The bigger Human caught the pad out of the air with one hand and began scrolling. “Holy fuck, Lerai, you’re so cute! Oh, oh my god, look at this one! Hahaha! She’s covered in mud! That’s too precious, she’s so proud of herself!”

“Stoooooop!” The bright-orange Venlil—Lerai—changed targets and ran straight towards the taller Human, only for her to throw the pad right back at the smaller one.

“Eeeee! Look at the next one! Oh, it’s bathtime! She’s like a sad wet soapy puppy!” 

“I said GIVE IT!”

Before Rika could throw her pad again, Lerai charged straight into her, bowling her over and pushing both of them to the ground. They immediately began wrestling on the padded floor, the Human struggling to keep the pad just out of reach with one arm and pushing on the Venlil’s snout with the other.

I leaned against a nearby wall, suppressing a sigh. This was at least *something…* but they were just like little pups playing roughly. 

Letting those two morons be for a moment, I took a look around the area. This one room took up a good eighty-ish percent of the whole building, and most of the floor was lined with soft padding. An enormous mirror took up the entire far wall, and off to one side, on harder ground, were several weights and workout machines. But the standout was definitely the big raised square in the middle of it all. It looked a bit worn and stained, but… maybe that was their arena? The stains didn’t look like blood, though, which was lame.

There were also a few other Humans in here. Just a few; the exterminators definitely outnumbered them. And all of them seemed pretty nervous about that fact, taking glances at the herd and quickly looking away whenever anyone noticed. One in particular, a *really* big male who might’ve been even bigger than the Takkan, was just watching the two on the ground with a look of expectation.

Unlike me, the exterminators were freaking out about the two on the ground. “Oh speh, th-this must be why they told us not to bring weapons!” one of them cried. “They’re gonna kill and eat us one by one now that we’re defenseless!”

The big Takkan from earlier, standing a whole head and ears above the herd, crossed his arms and flapped his ears dismissively. “This is something I was worried about. Predators wouldn’t have anything to teach us.”

“Kellic, you’re the guard, aren’t you? Do something!” pleaded another exterminator.

“Uh, b-but… I was ordered to only respond in case of a serious emergency,” replied the Gojid I saw at the entrance earlier. “I-I was allowed a stun gun, but–”

“A stun gun! Use it! Hurry! That Venlil’s gonna die if you don’t do anything!”

“But she’s–”

“All of you, stop!” The Krakotl I’d seen at the entrance—Teska, I think—held up a wing to silence the crowd, a knowing look in his eye. “Let them fight.”

Immediately, the herd began to bleat and bray in protest. “What do you mean?! She’s going to die!”

“We can’t just sit around!”

“I didn’t even want to be here, Teska! We’re only trying it because you talked us into it!”

“Kellic! By Tik’ta’s fury, man! Taze it! Taze the predator!”

“Stop!” The Krakotl screeched again, silencing their complaints. “Just watch. Trust me.”

It was clear that nobody agreed, but the one voice pushing against the herd was enough to make them pause, if only for a moment. So they watched, horrified and expecting the worst over these adults acting like rowdy pups. Stars, I just wanted to smear them all into the dirt.

The two wrestled for a little bit longer. But eventually, something imperceptible shifted. The Venlil had a different look in her eye.

“Alright, that’s it!” she bleated.

And then she…

…Wait, *whoa!*

The Venlil suddenly pivoted to the side, grabbed the Human’s arm that was pressing against her snout, slammed it palm-down into the ground, wrapped her own arms around it, and began to *twist her arm off at the shoulder.*

I was utterly mesmerized. I’d barely followed it, she’d done it so quickly! It was so simple; using her arm like a lever to overcome her likely stronger predator opponent, but I never would have thought of it! I’d been expecting teeth and claws from the predator fighting techniques. But *this…* This was something I could do without those things.

With that one motion, my mind was changed. I was locked in.

“Ah! Haha! Uncle!” Rika cried, her voice a mixture of pain and amusement.

“Give it! Give me back my pad!” Lerai bleated.

All of the exterminators were dead silent. I swore I heard a jaw hit the floor. Then, all at once, they began to chatter amongst themselves.

“Wh-What the… sh-she just disabled that Human so easily!”

“What the hell? How did she do that?”

“Oh, oh Protector, th-that predator’s gonna be furious! Wh-What if it goes for the throat?!”

“Why isn’t the predator fighting back? It can, can’t it?”

The Takkan was silent, just watching the exchange with narrowed eyes.

“Impressive, right?” Teska said. “That just happened without a flamer or a stun gun. I know this is hard to take in, but they can teach us how to safely disable a person without using a weapon, with *far* greater efficacy than EAT or anything we have at the guild. *That* is why I brought you all here.”

Features in the herd began to shift as he explained. A bunch of them went from fear and distrust to… interest. Ears, crests, and a pair of antennae wiggled, and tails swayed in thought. There were still a few freaking out a bit at the fact that a predator was about to get her arm removed, but it was obvious to me that the Venlil wasn’t actually going to finish breaking her bone.

Suddenly, a new growling, gravelly voice rumbled like a rockslide over the commotion. “That’s not all we’ll be teaching you,” it said.

From out of a side room stepped an elderly Human, using some kind of mobility aid. Quills bristled and wool flared at the sight of the new uncovered predator’s face, only to fall into confusion as we all began to wonder what in all the voids some old geezer was doing in a place like this.

He took a step closer, glancing down at the two wrestling on the floor. “The hell are you idiots doing?” he asked, like a parent scolding a pup. “We have guests.”

“Huh?” Lerai looked up at the Human, and then out towards the crowd. “Wait, when did they get he–ACK!”

Suddenly, Rika shoved her knee between Lerai’s arms and pried them apart, freeing herself from the Venlil’s attack. Predator limbs wound around prey before she even realized what was going on, and soon Lerai was getting choked by the predator’s legs, earning another round of surprised gasps from the crowd of exterminators. Me, though? I was *enthralled.*

“Bah! Ghk! Speh! Okay!” Lerai bleated, very deliberately tapping on the Human’s leg twice. And just like that, she was released. She stood, rubbing her neck. “Speh, where’d you learn to do that?”

“Chief taught me,” Rika replied, pushing herself to her feet. “I want a rematch, you know.”

“You’re on!”

“Another time, you two. Rika, give the kid back her pad, would you?” the Chief said, before turning towards us. “So you’re the ones who were brave enough to show up, hm? Well, if nothing else, I respect your bravery. I’m sure Teska here told you all what to expect today.”

“W-We’re still all pretty nervous, sir,” Teska admitted.

“I expected as much. So let me be clear.” The man’s gaze hardened, and his tone became more serious. “First, know that while injury is always a possibility, we have very strict safety standards and rules, and I will expect all of you to follow them to the letter. They are for *your* safety, so as long as you respect them, no harm will come to you. While you are in my class, you will follow my orders. Do you understand?”

The herd all glanced between each other. “Y-You’re the teacher?” asked a Farsul.

“That’s right.”

“But you’re… infirm.”

“That’s correct. And I also have several years of experience as a professional fighter, and decades of experience running a gym just like this on Earth. There are few more qualified to teach you than myself, and if you don’t believe that, then I assure you I will prove it in the coming days.”

My ears rose. *A professional fighter? Like… he fought as a job?*

“Moving on. Secondly, what we are going to teach you goes beyond mere violence. Many of you are already used to the concept, due to the nature of your work. But I doubt any of you *respect* violence as we do. To you, it is a hammer, and everything around you is a nail. But to us, martial arts are a way of life. A way to better ourselves, in mind, body, and spirit. To become stronger, so that we can solve our problems not with violence, but with peace. To learn and teach confidence, discipline, and integrity. And you will be expected to practice that philosophy at all times, not just in class.”

*Ew… lame. Brahk that, I just wanna learn how to break an arm like that Venlil just did.*

Despite my own thoughts, though, most of the exterminators were actually starting to look at this old guy differently. A bit of confusion, but mostly with respect.

“B-But I don’t understand,” asked a Tilfish. “How does violence solve anything peacefully?”

“Ha! That was the kid’s first question, too,” said the old man, motioning towards Lerai. “But rather than repeat the entire answer I gave her, how about I show all of you instead?”

My tail whipped back and forth in excitement. It was time to show everyone here what I could do. Soon, I’d break every one of these exterminators. ESPECIALLY that Takkan.

The man began to walk into the center of the big padded area, motioning to all of us to follow. “All of you, line up shoulder to shoulder. I am the Chief, and let me be the first to welcome you to the fight club, and to your first class.”

1o2wdz8,all,I Had a Hammer,"*Just some simple hammering*

I was deep underground. The life support unit hissing, while it circulated the air and cooled the exterior. A minor shift had caused a few thermal pipes to buckle. I was to straighten them out using this experimental power-armor. Neural pads linked me to the servo engines that negated the 900 pounds heavy suit. In my hand I held a hammer.

Tiny LEDs on the periphery of my vision told about the suit’s status. One orange blinking indicated I had only 6 hours of air left. Plenty of time. A team above was monitoring every sensor readout like I was a spacecraft venturing into the unknown. Maybe I was, I would be the first going 10 miles under rock and then beyond, where pressure got so high rocks turned liquid.

A constant murmur of voices droned from my speakers, as I walked through a maintenance shaft. I tried not to think about pressure. There was an entire mountain above me. And more.  Each step took effort, struggling with myself.

Then, mid-stride, sudden silence. The Earth trembled.

I froze. I did not know what to do. The tremors intensified. The shaft started to buckle. Desperate, I tried to go to the surface, but it collapsed. The lights went out and I no longer could move myself. I turned on my suit’s lighting.

Metal all around me. My suit offered a final solution.

Cryostasis.

I went through my options: none. Panic. Options again. My mind kept racing in a circle for at least an hour. To surrender myself to oblivion. A last Hail Mary. I wish I knew how to pray to her. Or anyone else.

In the end I just did it. An intense painful cold crept over my fingers and toes and higher, by the time it reached my chest, I wanted to scream, but no longer could.

Total sensory deprivation. I drifted away in a sea of blackness that lasted and lasted.

Then I woke. There was no one around me. My suit had brought me up after who knows how much time, slowly worming its way through the torn metal.

There was no life. Or at least nothing bigger than a microbe. Crying I wandered the surface. I smashed rocks to release my anguish. One place was turned into a sickly green by lichen. It was there where I discovered the truth.

Buried under some rocks I smashed, were remnants of buildings. I learned.

It had been almost ten thousand years. There had been an attack on Earth, the day I went underground. Everyone had died.

Except me.

I had a hammer. I flattened the earth, cleared fields, and after painstaking days, built the first machine. At night my suit digested the knowledge of humanity, stored in the building. At day I worked.

Soon there were machines operating machines, building more machines. The sound of hammering reverberated through the air.

In the old records, I saw what they did to us. They tried to exterminate us like bugs. I raged. Within weeks an intense beam had stripped the ozone layer. Within months the oceans fumed.

Humanity had tried to hide. In the end there was no hope left, and in a desperate attempt to leave something, every record, every seed, every genome was stored in vast underground vaults. It was not expected a human ever saw this again.

I raged harder.

Drones surveyed the landscape and discovered more vaults: seeds. Even some embryos of humans and animals. One year later, the landscape was turning green and the first cries of the newborn could be heard.

In the distance, skycranes loomed. Grinding noises punctuated purpose. The building sites never slept.

Giant dreadnoughts lifted into the sky. The roar of spaceship engines rustled the trees and birds flew deeper into the forest.

I had a hammer. Earth lives again. I watch the dreadnoughts leaving, returning the favor they once did upon us.

There is still a lot of hammering to do.",Beautiful-Hold4430,2025-10-10 15:08:16,241,1.0,22,263,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1o2wdz8/i_had_a_hammer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1o2wdz8/i_had_a_hammer/,self.humansarespaceorcs,0,Original Story,,0,none,[],3748,14,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o2kh8s,all,Factorio is basically visual coding,"Hi all. New Cracktorio addicted here (60hs in).

I am on my first playthrough and launched the rocket.

As everyone else, I built an spaghetti abomination that works well enough to launch the first rocket.

Now I started to ""actually play the game"", and working on improving how everything works.

Then it just hit me: Factorio is pretty much a visual programming language.

By ""fixing"" the production, I realized I am just refactoring the code.

Here is some interesting similarities i found between Factorio and coding:

- Resources are the raw input data. It's the initial input you use to deliver the final product
- Launching the rocket is the product you want to deliver, (an app, a report, or whatever you want the program to deliver)
- Everything else is the code!

- Each machine is just a function, that takes a set of inputs and give an output.

- OOP? Sure, create a set of functions (one or more different machines, and copy it when needed
- Something stopped working? Time to debug and apply fixes 
- need more efficiency? Time for code refactor
- libraries? Blueprints are there for you

- your next factory better and more efficient right from the start? Congratulations, you are now an experienced programmer.

So, there it is... If you play Factorio, you already are a software engineer. All you need now is to learn a new programing language!

EDIT: almost forgot:

Main bus = you central database
City blocks = micro services
Production columns = scalable servers
Trains = network/internet

1o3g92x,all,"OOCS: Of Dog, Volpir, and Man - Bk 8 Ch 42","Shalkas

Down on street level, Shalkas is walking a meandering route in her casual clothes. There’s nothing on her to suggest she’s more than she seems, save the axiom holster tattoo that covers up the new Tiger kinetic pistol she'd been given. A gift from the Humans. She has one of those big woman-portable machine guns coming too, but that would be far too obvious a tell for a day like today, and might have even put her at a disadvantage in the streets. 

No, her shrapnel cannon and combat knives would get the job done if push came to shove. Especially the big scary knife she'd gotten from a man called Sergeant Major Gurung, his personal thanks for saving the Admiral. It’s a big, curved, weighted blade: a cousin to certain Cannidor weapons. It’s nasty, and Sergeant Major Gurung had even taught her to use it properly. If all that didn't work, there was also the other present she'd gotten from Wichen Bridger when she was picking up her pistol. Gods only know if she could even fight with a plasma sword properly, but it sure looks cool. 

High Canis is a lot like most other Cannidor capital cities, constructed in the classical style. Nar'Korek is actually fairly modern in its architectural design, comparable to the Corporate Sector or the more modernist clans, with its strong emphasis on breaking up chunks of the city with large nature reserves and other green spaces; traditional cities, in contrast, were generally built around a literal mountain, spreading out layer after layer and ring after ring until you reached the ground level and the real sprawl of the city began. 

Not that Cannidor cities tend to sprawl too much; High Canis is the exception. The Golden Khan doesn't rule with a particularly heavy hand, but administering and dealing with the needs of hundreds of worlds isn’t something one can manage without a very advanced bureaucracy. Learning that particular lesson had resulted in a lot of bloodshed before the Sixth Golden Khan, the Empire Forger, had beat just about every Khan in Cannidor space's head like a drum and asserted what was now the modern Cannidor interstellar state.

The sprawl here in High Canis has many points and purposes, but most of it exists to contain the organs of the Cannidor nation-state, and the lifeblood of Cannidor culture. So you have a wide mix of arenas, stadiums, ancient graveyards, monuments, memorials, shrines, temples, industrial parks, security forces or military barracks… and, of course, the estates of the powerful. 

There are also plenty of places for laborers to live and work, be they skilled artisans in some of the most prestigious crafting houses in Cannidor space, privileged to still make fighting steel or armor on the cradle world of their people, or the various hundreds of thousands of service workers, both Cannidor and exotic, feeding the masses, cooking for the elite, tending the garden of a Khan's holdings, and so much more. All of it was vital right down to the sanitation engineers in the bowels of the city. One of the better paid non-warrior professions in Cannidor space, actually: a shitty job, literally and figuratively, but society would literally collapse without that particular group of specialists. 

All of that means there are plenty of nooks, crannies, corners, and other places for the decidedly dark side of the Cannidor world to get its claws dug in. Red light districts, casinos, legal and otherwise, the occasional dungeon, drug dens, illegal breweries, arms smugglers and gods only know what else.

Shalkas is among those nooks and crannies, slinking past the colorfully painted doors of one substantial establishment: a pleasure house, though not in the galactic sense, like some mere brothel. This would be a place for the well to do to pay for pleasant or pleasurable company, men or women specially trained in the arts of music, conversation, art, poetry... and companionship. It was a pleasure house, after all, but all the earthly pleasures would be emphasized. Not just sating one's animal lusts. 

The real pleasure houses serve the highest of the warrior elite, and their companions are well compensated and there entirely of their own volition. Usually a play by the low-born man to secure high-born wives, either for their own comfort, or to help their birth families. 

It’s a play that almost always works, and had even accidentally brokered some peace treaties in Cannidor history. Such places are neutral ground and were popular in days gone by for meetings between war ladies… and more than a few clever bulls had gotten a little too clever and managed to seduce the leaders of both sides of a dispute, leading to things generally being settled far more 'amicably' than they otherwise might have been.   

However, what the rich and powerful will do, those who fancy themselves similar will try to imitate... usually with far cruder results. The lower you go, the worse the pleasure houses become, until they degrade into common brothels with a thin veneer of civilization on top.    

Funnily enough, though, once you get out of the shadow of the city, things get brighter again. The countryside is where Shalkas personally is hoping most of the crew would choose to visit. She'd helped arrange shuttles to some of the larger towns and cities to encourage just that, and gods know they'd be happy to have visitors. 

Not like certain parts of High Canis, which don't take kindly to strangers of any species. 

Even her. 

Shalkas keeps a wary eye out as she continues to tail her target. The mark is moving smartly, but hasn't given any signs she'd been made - just a normal run of the mill thug, talking with girls who could either be friends or fellow gang members. Shalkas' new eye implants get nice, clear, high resolution images of their faces and send them up to the fleet intelligence directorate. 

Diana Bridger had been awfully generous with the high-end hardware. Part of Shalkas wants to have it all removed and sold off to send back to her community, but Jerry had said he was looking after her girls. Had even shown her the contract with Cannid Solutions. Before long, they'd be getting picked up and flown to their new homes, and a fresh start.

They just have to get this deal across the finish line, and that means Shalkas is very invested in making this happen. Not for herself. Not for the guy she likes. Not for his family. Not for the Undaunted. So she can finally make good on the promise she'd made to lead that community home. 

The gangster she's been tailing looks in a few directions, leading Shalkas to move back into shadow for a bit; finally, the other woman disappears down an alleyway that appears to lead to a pleasure house. There’s a marking on the wall, worked in some graffiti, that she recognizes. It signifies an entrance to a Black Khans den, likely concealed within said pleasure house. A classic for the Khans, especially for the more established chapters; they don't fuck with tradition. 

Jackpot. 

""Midnight to control. Got a possible entry point into a Black Khans facility. Or some other organized crime group. I-""

The transmission cuts out as strong hands grab Shalkas and haul her through a nearby set of doors. Somebody’s triggered a privacy field.

She doesn't panic. This particular abduction technique is one she knows very well. She'd been trained in it… at the Cannidor Security Forces Academy. She's just been picked up by the cops. 

*They must be on a stakeout*, Shalkas considers as she elbowed one of her captors hard in the ribs, making the other woman grunt with pain. No way they’d taken over somewhere this fast just to get a good look at her. 

That said, they aren’t talking to her either. Aren’t breaking out the cuffs, so Shalkas throws a few more elbows and trips another woman, putting her on the floor. The scuffle almost turns into a brawl until another woman manages to get a run at her and shoves her shoulder square into Shalka’s sternum. The armor under her clothes takes the impact but it still shoves her into the middle of a dark room, and the low whine of a rail gun charging is more than enough to get Shalkas’ attention. 

Plasma resistant fur isn’t worth much against hypersonic metal darts, after all. 

‘Alone’ in the darkness, she can hear presumed officers prowling around, until at last someone shines a handheld light in her face from a respectable distance away. Still no one says anything. Probably trying to run her against a database. Which isn’t great for Shalkas, but not bad either. Whatever she does, she has to stay calm. 

She’d been cut off in the middle of a transmission. Control had her position and is almost certainly sending back up her way. She had trained for this a bit. Standard Undaunted response time for this kind of thing in this sort of situation was minutes on the slow end. So, she just has to play for time... and preferably not start a firefight with CanSec officers. 

That'd put a dampener on negotiations for sure. 

Still, as the minutes drag on like hours, and Shalkas tries different methods of getting past the signal jammer with her implants, she hears something. Something small. Like something in the vents. Or slipping through a side door. Help may have just arrived. So the best thing she can do now is get their attention firmly on her… and if need be, drop to the ground, roll clear of the ‘X’ she’s standing on and pray she isn’t the only one on her side in the ensuing fight. 

""If none of you talk, this is gonna get awkward really quick.""

Her tone is casual. As relaxed as she can force it to be. Easy bait for less even tempered cops. Shalkas would know. She’d been one of those less even tempered cops once upon a time.  

A voice laughs in response. ""Well, I'll be damned, girls. We don’t need confirmation from the station. I’d know that voice anywhere. It really is her. I thought I was seeing things. Shalkas, you filthy piece of garbage."" 

Each word has more and more venom in it until the speaker outright spits the word 'garbage' at her; she steps into the light and Shalkas resists letting out a sigh. Of course, it just had to be her. Her least favorite cousin. Cagadai Chori. Now wearing the badge of a Cannidor Sector Security Force detective. 

""Chori. Nice to see you again. Congrats on the promotion.""

Chori snarls. ""Don't speak casually to me, filth. You might have been my cousin once but you're nothing now!"" 

""Whatever you say, detective.""

Chori’s already letting herself get emotional about the situation, which wasn’t good. Gods only know what the rest of the clan have been told about Shalkas getting set up as revenge for her drug bust, but she’s here on legitimate enough business, and with some very powerful friends. Friends who would be looking for her.  

""So... What brings garbage like you here? Thought you were still slumming it in Corp Space.""

""New employer, actually.""

""...Uh huh. Who’s that? Heard you were spotted with a pirate gang on Giyadi Star Base. You get sent to make contact with the Black Khans or some shit? Messenger, maybe?""    

""Would you believe I was undercover with the pirates to rescue the Human admiral having his triumph up at the Golden Khan's palace?""

It’s the truth. Not the worst thing to start with, right?

Unfortunately, it just makes Chori laugh. An ugly, cold laugh, as more anger floods her eyes.

""You could at least make up a decent lie, filth.""  

*'Probably shouldn't tell her I'm trying to get signed up to knock boots with said Human admiral either,'* Shalkas reasons, continuing to hold her tongue as Chori rants at her. 

She can feel the tension rising, but suddenly, there's a crackle of energy and a charging rail pistol was in Chori's hand.

""You know what? You don't want to cooperate, tell me what you're up to? That's fine. She's still armed. Right, girls?""

""Yes ma'am, the girl who tried to go for any weapons got laid out flat."" calls one of the voices in the darkness. 

A quick switch to thermal vision in her new augments lets Shakas pick out the speaker clearly, along with the rest of Chori's team of four. Normal for this kind of operation in CanSec. It also lets her pick out... figures that shouldn't be there. Small figures by Cannidor standards. Suddenly Shalkas is entirely relaxed, even staring down the barrel of her cousin's rail gun. 

""You're making a mistake, Chori.""

""The hell I am. I'm correcting one. They never should have let you live for what you did to the clan. Shame you died resisting arrest, though. I'll be sure to tell your mother personally...""

Before Chori can twitch a finger, however, a green laser sight illuminates the spot right between Chori's eyes. 

""Undaunted Marines! Drop your weapon and put your hands in the air or we start filling body bags."" A crisp, feminine voice with what Shalkas recognizes as a British accent echoes through the room as Chori's eyes open wide.

""The Undaunted? The hell are you doing? I'm detaining a vicious criminal!""

""You're detaining a security contractor employed by the Undaunted from the Bridger clan's private intelligence service. You are obstructing a vital counter intelligence operation against local criminal elements believed to be conspiring against Undaunted personnel. Now put the gun down or I swear to whatever you believe in, I will make you eat it.""

With a threat like that, and targeting lasers already on the mark, most people would at least listen, but Chori had always been... a bit... bull headed to say the least. It had been hoped she'd grow out of it but that clearly hasn't been the case. 

""Oh yeah? You and what army? I'm the law here.""

A small black-clad figure walks into the light, wearing a full face helmet with an opaque visor. The figure is clearly feminine, rare among the Undaunted commandos to start with, and slender enough she’s either using axiom pockets for her assets or she’s Human. The face plate goes clear, revealing it is indeed the latter - Emma, if Shalkas remembered right from the pre drop briefing. Eldest daughter of Sir David, and now the number two commando on the ship.

""...Major Forsythe. I'm surprised they sent someone as senior as you out after me.""

Emma's eyes lock on Shalkas for a moment like a falcon considering a possible meal. ""The Admiral only sends the best when his people are in danger. Who is this?"" Emma gestures at Chori, clearly unimpressed by the much taller woman.

""Detective Cagadai Chori, my cousi-""

""I am NOT your cousin anymore, you goddamn tra-"" 

Anger makes Chori's finger start to tighten, and there's suddenly a slight flash from around Emma's wrist, a flicker of motion, and a knife sprouts in one of the cooling vents that allows the railgun tracks to naturally bleed off heat in atmosphere, blocking the barrel completely, the apparently magnetic material also disrupting the very circuit. 

""Let's take our finger off the trigger before someone has an accident, shall we?""

Chori's eyes are wide open now. Shalkas' would have been too if she hadn't been trying to keep herself composed as possible. She'd barely seen Emma's hand move! From Chori's perspective that was probably pretty close to black magic!

""How in the hells did you-""

""Fuck you, that's how!"" A male voice calls out from nearby. 

Chori's mouth drops a little bit. ""A man? Here?""

""Actually, all of the commandos that are immediately on hand are men, save myself,"" Emma says, clearly getting more than a bit annoyed. Chori was clearly underestimating the smaller woman, and for a professional head kicker like Dame Emma, Shalkas figured that was fighting words in the Human woman’s book. 

When she speaks again, Emma’s tone is ice cold, dropping the temperature of the room a few degrees. ""Now. Are you going to release our woman or do I need to get the Admiral on the comm so he can hash it out personally with the Golden Khan? I believe they're having a drink at the moment, so it shouldn't be too hard.""

""...You're goddess damn serious,"" Chori says, shock fully setting in now.

""As a grave.""

Chori's eyes flick back to Shalkas. ""...I don't know how you managed to get such powerful friends, scum, but rest assured I will find out. Girls. Weapons down. The prisoner can depart. I'll be filing a protest with my superiors about this. This woman is a known criminal who-""

""Whom the case against could be called out as bullshit by a five year old who had barely learned how to read Galactic Trade, and has then spent the rest of her days protecting people, culminating in saving the Admiral at great risk to her own neck,"" scoffs a man whom Shalkas recognizes by voice as William 'Willie' Wingate from briefing the Commandos and teaching them about the Cannidor, to include limited language lessons. ""Shalkas, is there a word in Cannidor for 'An obvious set up'?""

Human audacity never failed to impress. Shalkas would credit it to being on the right side of the gun, but Humans would mouth off regardless. One more thing that made them a lot like Cannidor. 

""Not really. There's some idioms that work for it though, but they're complicated.""

""Hmm. Damn. Tell me about them later. I'm getting bored with the normal language learning module.""

""Sure, Willie. Whatever you want."" 

Shalkas looks over at Chori, trying to apologize... but Chori won't even meet her gaze. All she can do is slip out of the building with the Undaunted commandos, falling into place next to Emma.

""No love lost there, clearly,"" Emma says matter-of-factly, a slight edge of sympathy in her tone.

Shalkas sighs. ""Well. That particular bridge was burned a long time ago. Let's get back, though... I think I might have a line on one of the dens our friends are hiding in.""

""Going to ask to investigate?""

""Yep... but first I'm going to need a couple buckets of fur dye if I’m doing anything away from friendly troops.""

1o2owvm,all,Back From Japan: My First-Timer Tips + Post-Japan Depression,"
My husband and I just finished our first trip to Japan in mid-September, and wow, it was incredible. I wanted to share a few practical takeaways I learned. I’ll be focusing on things I didn't see constantly repeated in the sub.

1. Early Bird

If you and your travel companion aren't naturally early risers (like, 6:00 AM early), you might need a mindset shift or be okay with cutting places from your list.

The Reality: A surprising number of shops, temples, and attractions close early, think 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM. We missed a few spots because we didn't leave the hotel until 9:30 AM or 10:00 AM (e.g., the Daibutsu at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, and some dining areas like those in Umeda Sky Building).

The Takeaway: Start practicing that early wake-up routine now, or meticulously check the last admission time for every key site you want to visit. 

EDIT: I just want to emphasize that it’s totally up to you what time you want to start your day, just enjoy the places you choose to visit and enjoy the time spent with you travel companion. There’s so many things to do in Japan even after a lot of shops have closed for the day. I’m naturally an early riser (and I get tired and sleepy quite early in the evening) as opposed to my husband, so at first I felt sad and frustrated that we had to cross out some places in our itinerary because of our limited time. 

2. Think You Packed Light? Go Lighter.

I genuinely thought I was a light-packer. I was wrong. By the middle of the trip, I realized I was hauling way too much.

My New Mantra: For the next trip, no matter the length, I’m bringing only 3 sets of outside clothes and 1 set of sleeping clothes. Japanese hotels often have excellent, fast laundry machines. I will be using them next time.

Skincare & Hygiene: If I can buy it in a Japanese drug store (like Don Quijote or Matsumoto Kiyoshi), I'm not packing it. (Edit: I have a skin condition for which I have 1 product that I use; I also react badly to some facial wash; so I’ll be packing just those 2 skincare products next time. Other than that, I’ll use whatever the hotel provides and/or just buy them.)

3. Shopping Needs Its Own Schedule

Don't try to squeeze in souvenir hunting / shopping between temples and museums; it’s inefficient and stressful.

The Takeaway: Dedicate 1 to 2 full days exclusively to shopping. Plan ahead where you need to go (Akihabara for figures, Ginza for department stores, Tokyo Station Character Street for Mofusand/Gachapon, etc.) so you can hit all your targets at once. (Edit: Based on my recent research, for the items we plan to buy next time, Shinjuku has most of the stores we want to check out.)

4. Optimize Your Variety

In a country with this much to offer, make sure your itinerary is balanced to avoid 'temple fatigue' or 'city burnout.'

The Takeaway: Review your attractions. Is it a good mix? Try to balance high-energy days with relaxed ones: a temple morning, a museum afternoon, an observatory deck evening, followed by a park day or an exhibit. Do the same with food: try local washoku, but also make time for their amazing Italian food, pizza, or a themed cafe.

5. Time Estimates are Key (and Often Longer than You Think)

Google Maps can give you travel time, but it won't tell you the experience time.

The Takeaway: Research how long people actually spend at major attractions. My personal estimates:
    *teamLab Borderless: Give yourself a solid 3–4 hours to fully wander and get lost.
    *Nara Park (full experience): Plan for at least one full day if you want to see the main temple, the museum, and any special exhibits.

***

The Aftermath: Post-Japan Depression (PJD)

I didn't know this was a real phenomenon until I felt it. About a week after returning, I was hit with a serious emotional low, like a what's the point of my normal life? kind of feeling. I have a history of depression, and this felt alarmingly familiar. 

(Edit: Just wanted to add that I was diagnosed with depression a few years back, went to therapy, and last year I stopped feeling like I want to off myself everyday. Why does it seem like some of the people here think that depression isn’t real??)

Just a warning: Maybe like for me it can hit you hard because the contrast between Japanese efficiency/beauty and normal life is so stark.

How I'm Coping: 
*I'm currently taking a pause from heavy work projects.
*Getting morning sunlight and eating all my favorite comfort foods.
*Most importantly: I've already started planning our next trip for next year. We were going to go elsewhere, but I can't bring myself to choose anything but Japan (Shirakawa-go, Kyoto, and Hakone are next). We'll be staying even longer this time.

---

I hope these tips help you on your travels. Are any of you currently dealing with PJD, and if so, how are you powering through?

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your time in Japan!

EDIT: English is not my first language so I had help from AI to make my post clearer and easier to understand.

1o0j4sd,all,Space Wizard,"The wizard stood, staff in hand. He gazed into the starry void, pondering one of the great secrets of the universe. 

“Why?” the wizard asked. “Why do I keep getting myself into these things?” 

Jake Mundane didn’t look like a learned and terrible wizard. He looked like an edgy college kid. He was a little over average height, but skinny. Dirty blonde hair flowed down over his shoulders. He wore a long leather trenchcoat, black jeans, and a maroon turtleneck. An iron medallion hung around his neck. He was clean shaven, and his neatly trimmed fingernails were painted black. 

Looking closer would only make him seem even less wizard-like. He moved like a dancer, all smooth motion and sensual grace. His brown eyes glittered with warmth and humor. His default expression was a hint of a smile, like he was thinking about a joke he’d heard earlier that day. Nothing about him screamed practitioner of the arcane arts. 

Nothing about him screamed suicidally stupid, either, but here he was.

“Are you sure about this, Jake?” A voice cut through the wizard’s musings. Female. Pretty. Very dead. “I think this might be a stupid idea.” 

Jake rolled his eyes. The dead woman had a point, but he wasn’t about to admit it. “You’ve been saying that for three weeks, Jules. If you were gonna talk me out of it you’d have done it by now.” 

Jake was standing in the airlock of his ship, the *Wicked Game*. It was an old Bridger class freighter. It was an ugly rickety rectangular block with engines. It looked like it should fall out of the sky, but it was the best he could get on short notice. 

The *Wicked Game* clanked and groaned ominously as it propelled itself through the void. The interior was dim and dingy. Lights flickered on and off, giving the impression that the ship was haunted. Which it was. Technically. 

“No, Jake,” Julia corrected. “I’ve been saying your half-assed slapped together rescue operation is a bad idea for three weeks. Now I’m talking about your even dumber plan to assault a hidden alien station by yourself. You’re not even bringing any guns.” 

“I don’t need a gun, Jules,” Jake pointed out. He took another look at the sensor readings on his wall console. The moon he’d be aiming for was tiny. Less than a third the size of Earth’s moon. The moon itself was unremarkable. Just a round hunk of rock orbiting a gas giant. The installation on that moon was another matter. “If I wore one it would just explode, anyway.”

It wasn’t a big facility. A round dome roughly two miles across. The dome didn’t show up on sensors. If Jake’s tracking spell hadn’t pointed him at the thing he never would have known it was there. A scrying spell had revealed the dome was surrounded by turrets, weapon platforms, and sensor arrays. It was definitely a secure facility. Probably Military, but he couldn’t be sure.

The facility was deep in Nurral Republic space. The nurrals weren’t at war with humanity. Not yet. But they weren’t exactly friendly, either. Jake could only think of a few reasons they would kidnap a human and bring her to such a place. None of those reasons were good. 

“I know, I know,” Julia sounded exasperated. “Your stupid magic transporter will detonate anything with a power source. Which is why you’re planning to assault a secret Nurral Military base with no guns. By yourself. Like a moron.” 

“Why Julia,” Jake gasped. “For a moment there it sounded like you were worried about me.” 

“Of course I’m worried, you jackass!” Julia snapped. “If you die I’m stuck haunting some stupid freighter in the middle of Nurral Republic space. Or worse, they could blow up the ship. Then I’d just be haunting a debris field.” 

“It’s not that bad, Jules,” Jake reminded her. “I’ve got you set up so you can fly the ship. You can get out of here if things go south.” 

“I won’t get very far,” Julia pointed out. “You’re the only one that can recast the illusion making us look like a nurral ship.” She let out a dramatic sigh. “How did I let you talk me into this?”

“I didn’t,” Jake reminded her. “Tagging along was your idea.” 

“I wouldn’t have had to if you hadn’t sold our house to buy this stupid ship,” the dead woman groused. “The new owners would probably exorcise me.” 

“I like you too, Jules.” Jake grinned and adjusted his sunglasses. It felt a little silly wearing sunglasses in space, but they were a convenient vessel for his communication spell. It wouldn’t do any good to take the station if he couldn’t call Jules to come pick him up. “Are we ready?” 

“You tell me,” said Julia. “I’m not a wizard.” 

“I didn’t mean the array,” said Jake. “I’m doing the final checks right now.” The array was a complicated set of circles and runes that had been meticulously carved into the deck and walls of the airlock. The symbols connected to a metal box which was also engraved. “I mean are you ready? I know I’m asking a lot, Jules. But I do need you.”

“I’ll be fine, Jake,” said the woman. ”I don’t like this plan, but I’ll do my part. I’ve got your back.”

“Thanks, Julia.” Jake was glad she’d insisted on coming along. Jake didn’t have a lot of friends. Julia’s constant grumpy concern choked him up a little sometimes. “I appreciate you.” 

Jake looked over the inscriptions on the metal box. The box was connected by cables to a device on the outside of the ship. The device was a Lightrider ZX40. A very expensive piece of magi-tech. It had cost more than the ship. Lightriders converted matter into sunbeams. The sunbeam spell would last until the light hit something solid. Then the spell would break and whatever got beamed would be back to normal. Lightriders were usually used to transmit cargo, but the tech had been invented to insert troops into warzones.

It was an unpleasant and dangerous way to travel. A beam of light is a fragile thing. If the light gets distorted or refracted you’d reappear in pieces. If you hit something reflective you might bounce back into space and spend the next hundred thousand years as a semi-conscious burning beam of light. Lightriders had been used a lot in the Mage War. The Mage Corps called it Riding the Lightning. They didn’t call it that because it was fun.

Jake was very familiar with riding the lightning. He didn’t like it much. He took a deep breath and checked his gear one last time. It wasn’t much. Jake had several potions, two rings, a silver knife, a shortsword, and his staff. Not a cool magi-tech staff, either. It was just plain wood with runes carved on it. Rounding out the gear was a small bag of crystals and his enchanted sunglasses. 

Jake typed into his wall console, checking the Lightrider’s trajectory. He made sure nothing was about to drift into the way. Satisfied, he activated the array. “Alright, here we go. Stay on course for now. Don’t head for the station until I’ve cleared out the defenses. If things go sideways…” 

“I know, I know,” Julia sounded annoyed. “Get out of here and contact the Military.” 

“What? No.” Jake smirked. “If things go sideways you’re supposed to come rescue my ass.” 

“Shut up and go already.” Jules quipped. Jake got the feeling she was rolling her eyes. “Be careful.” 

“I always am,” Jake lied. He closed his eyes and let his will flow into the circles. He added his magic to the array, following the lines and cables to the Lightrider. 

Working magic in space was tricky. Magic was produced by life. Habitable planets were full of the stuff, but space? Not so much. Fortunately, science had found a solution. Mage crystals. Pure magic, condensed into matter. A hefty chunk of them were powering the Lightrider. Jake’s magic touched them, guiding the forces of creation into the array. He let the power build. The glyphs of the array came to life, glowing orange. A deep thrumming vibrated its way through the airlock. 

Jake didn’t really need to guide the magic himself. The Lightrider was designed to automate the spell. On the other hand, this was his last chance to catch any problems if there was something wrong with the array. He wasn’t about to take chances. 

It took a minute for the spell to build. When the thrumming reached its peak, Jake gave the command that would activate the enchantment. “”Transportari.”

Jake was suddenly on fire. 

Being turned into a sunbeam was extremely painful. It felt like every nerve in his body had been set on fire at the same time. Normally the sensation only lasted for a tiny fraction of a second, but the *Wicked Game* was ten light minutes from the research station. Jake was treated to ten excruciating minutes, time he spent rethinking his life choices.

The sunbeam struck the brown rock of the barren moon about ten feet from the hidden station’s dome. Jake was suddenly back in his body, but the burning sensation persisted for another several seconds. Jake gritted his teeth, focusing his will on his medallion.

The medallion was a holdover from his military days. A simple iron disk with his name, Ident number, and birth date on the front. The back of the medallion was engraved with a few basic but very handy enchantments. Jake focused on one of those enchantments and created a bubble of pressurized atmosphere around himself.

Next he reached into the pouch on his belt. He pulled out a small mage crystal and slotted it into the ring on his left hand. An effort of will attached the ring’s enchantment to the crystal. It would make him invisible to sensors. He hoped. Jake knew it worked for human tech, but he’d never dealt with the nurrals before. 

“Jake?” Julia’s voice rang in Jake’s ear, courtesy of his magic sunglasses. “Are you ok? Did you make it?” 

“I’m here,” Jake replied. He held out his left hand, focusing his will on his senses. He didn’t feel any magic coming from the dome. “Good news. It’s not warded.” 

“Warded?” Julia sounded suspicious. “What would’ve happened if it was?” 

“I’d probably be dead already,” Jake told her. “At the very least, it would be a lot harder to get in.” 

“You couldn’t have mentioned that before?” Julia sounded annoyed. 

“No point,” said Jake. “There was no way to check without getting closer.” He shrugged. “It was pretty unlikely, though. Nurrals are a tech species. They’ve got no magic to speak of.”  

Most species that reached the stars were either all magic or all science. Trying to mix the two tended to end badly. Only humanity and two other species had managed to use both without destroying themselves. After the Mage War humanity was the only one left. The sole wielders of magi-tech.

“Anyway,” Jake continued, “the place isn’t warded. Are the glasses working?” 

“Like a charm,” said Julia. “I can see everything you see.” 

“Good.” Jake pulled out a potion. He checked the label to make sure he had the right one. “GHOSTFORM’ was scribbled on it. “We’ll need to stay quiet once we’re in. Keep an eye out, but don’t say anything unless it’s an emergency.”

The moon’s gravity was low enough that drinking was a problem, but Jake was prepared. He slipped an airtight seal and a straw over the bottle and sipped as hard as he could. 

The potion set his stomach to roiling. Cold seeped into him. Jake’s body turned transparent. He stepped through the wall of the research center’s dome. He found himself facing a second, slightly smaller dome. Jake stepped through that one, too. He waited 5 more seconds for the potion to wear off. 

The interior of the station wasn’t that much different from what he’d see from humans. Steel walls, painted white. It was well lit and meticulously sterile. The atmosphere was a little more humid than Jake was used to, and the artificial gravity was a little lighter, but overall it wasn’t too bad. Jake was in a room full of metal crates. Some kind of storage space. Perfect. 

Jake hadn’t been able to bring his tracking spell with him. It was still plugged into the *Wicked Game*. This would be a good place to cast a new one. He pulled a pouch out of his pocket and extracted a pair of hairs. 

Jake gathered his will. “Invenire, invenire, invenire,” he chanted. He didn’t really need to use latin for spells. He just liked the way it sounded. He did need to speak, though. Jake’s brand of magic was all about the Will and the Word. 

He didn’t have to chant long. Maybe fifteen seconds to gather the power and form the spell in his mind. When he felt the spell had enough charge he ate the hair. Then he whispered, “Invenire locare.” 

He felt it then. A warm tickle in the back of his mind. He knew which direction Rachel was with the same instincts that used to tell him which way was North back on Earth. The spell wouldn’t tell him how close the girl was, or the best way to get to her. That was fine. A general direction was all he needed. 

Jake pulled another crystal out of his pouch. His tracking spell didn’t take a lot of juice, but casting a veil was another matter. He had a limited amount of internal power, and he didn’t want to run dry. Jake connected to the crystal with an effort of will and said, “Insinuatis.” He felt the veil ripple into place around him. His ring was (hopefully) hiding him from sensors, but now no one would see, hear, or smell him. Probably. 

Jake listened carefully at the door to the storage room. He didn’t hear anything. He opened the door and stepped out. He was in a corridor. He didn’t see anything that would give him a clue what this place was. Jake supposed there was no help for it. He started walking, following the general direction of his tracking spell.  

The corridors were empty at first, but soon enough he started to see people. The nurrals were an ugly bunch. They were purple frog people, with bulging yellow eyes and moist skin. They all wore white. The soldiers were in white armor. Sealed armor, with clear glass faceplates. There were a lot of them and they were heavily armed. They patrolled in groups of eight and spoke into comm devices every five minutes to check in.

The other nurrals were in void suits. Hazmat suits? Some kind of sealed suit. They were bulky and came with glass bubble helmets like something out of a bad 19th century sci-fi. Sensors and strange equipment dangled from harnesses draped over their shoulders. Scientists, maybe? They were a grim bunch. Quiet. Jake only saw a few of them. 

Jake held his breath the first few times he saw someone, but the veil held. He wandered the corridors without incident for ten whole minutes. Then he found a security checkpoint. There were sixteen guards with guns in hand. Another pair sat at monitoring stations, and two more stood ready at a set of scanners. 

Jake kept the veil up and watched. He had to wait for nearly an hour before anyone used the checkpoint. He saw the scientist walk through the scanner, then wait while a guard passed a different scanning device over him. When that was done one of the other guards at the security console typed in a code and pushed a button that opened the security door. 

Ok. Now he knew how to get the door open. The question was what to do about the guards. Jake didn’t think his veil was good enough to sneak in with a scientist through all that scanning equipment. If he wanted to get to Rachel he was going to have to take out security. 

Killing the guards would be the simplest solution, but he didn’t want to do that yet. He still had no idea what this place was. Best to keep things nonlethal for now. Jake retreated down the corridor until he saw an empty room. He stepped into it and closed the door behind him, thinking.

The nurrals were taking security very seriously. If the guard station went silent Jake figured someone would notice within minutes. He was going to attract attention no matter what he did. To hell with it, then. If Jake couldn’t be subtle, he might as well go big. 

Jake pulled a formation pen out of his pocket. It looked like a basic marker, but the ink had been enchanted to stick to any surface regardless of gravity or atmosphere. Jake didn’t need a formation for basic spells or quick and dirty invocation, but circles and symbols would take some of the strain off his mind and greatly increase the precision and power of his magic. 

Jake started with a simple circle. The ritual circle was the most common and basic formation. It didn’t have to actually be a circle. The symbols used in a spell were arbitrary and depended on the wielder. Jake knew some wizards that used triangles, and one that insisted on using a rhombus. But for Jake, it was circles.

Jake drew two more circles around the first. Then he started in on the runes. Jake had been taught to use Norse runes, but the type didn’t matter so long as you could keep the meaning clear in your head. 

Setting up the formation took half an hour. It took an hour of chanting and five large mage crystals before the spell was ready. It was a lot of energy. Jake hadn’t tried anything this big in years. Even with the circles, Jake’s will struggled to contain it all. 

Jake was drenched in sweat by the time the spell was ready. He said a single word. “Somnum.” Latin for sleep. He tapped the formation with his staff, willing the spell to release. The Mage Crystals crumbled to dust. The energy flooded out of the formation with a rush. It flooded out of Jake, too. He swayed for a moment, supporting himself on his staff. 

While spells were fueled by magic, shaping and channeling that magic took a lot of energy. Casting a spell strained Jake’s body and mind the same way lifting something heavy would. He gave himself a minute to recover before he recast his veil and stepped back into the corridor. 

Jake made his way back to the security checkpoint. He liked what he saw. All twenty of the guards were slumped over. A few of them were snoring. 

“It worked,” Jake said aloud. “You can talk now, Jules.”

“What did you do?” asked the dead woman. 

“Sleep spell,” Jake explained. “Should hold for a few hours.” 

“Won’t somebody notice when the guards don’t check in?” Julia asked. 

“There’s no one to notice,” Jake told her. “I went big. Everyone within three miles is unconscious.""

Julia was silent for a moment. “I didn’t know you could do that.”

“Yeah, it’s pretty cool.” Jake shrugged. “No good for combat, though. It takes too long to cast and people with magic of their own can resist it.” He stepped over an unconscious guard and typed in the code to open the checkpoint door. “Don’t change course yet, though. I don’t want some automated defense turret blowing my ride out of the sky.” 

The security door hissed open. Jake walked into yet another corridor. He found another set of guards on the other side. They were sleeping. Jake thought about taking one of their guns, but decided against it. Chances were they were rigged to only work for nurrals, anyway. 

A short walk took Jake to a large clear window. The window showed a big open room. An infirmary. There were ten doctors and half a dozen patients inside. Nurrals. Jake peered in through the window and came very close to throwing up. 

“What the hell is that?” Julia gasped. 

“It’s what I was afraid of,” Jake said grimly. He saw a nurral whose arm had been replaced with a large hairy clawed appendage. Another patient was writhing. He was hooked up to a machine that was pumping blood into him. The other four patients were warped. Their bodies were all twisted up. They didn’t look dead, but they probably wished they were. 

“The Mage War showed everyone what supernatural troops can do,” Jake explained. “Like most tech nations, the Nurral Republic killed all their magic beings centuries ago. If they want magic for their soldiers they’ll have to get it from someone else.” 

“Super soldiers,” Julia guessed. “It’s a super soldier program.” 

“That’s what it looks like,” Jake agreed. “My guess is they’re kidnapping preternaturals and running experiments. Trying to transfer the powers. I just hope we got here in time.” 

“You don’t know?” Julia asked. 

“The tracking spell will find the body whether she’s alive or dead,” Jake explained. 

“That’s…” Jake could hear Julia’s consternation. “You mean we’re going through all this trouble to save your ex-girlfriend, and she might already be dead!?” 

“Client,” Jake chided. “We’re saving our client, not my ex.” 

“She’s not a client unless you’re getting paid, Jake,” the dead woman pointed out. “You sold our house for this!” 

“I know.” Jake grimaced. He started walking again. “I had to, Jules. I’ve gotta know.” 

Jake found more infirmaries. More labs. Eventually he came to another security check point. He typed in the code. The door didn’t open. Jake tried again. No dice.

“Well that’s not good,” he quipped. 

“A different code for each checkpoint?” Julia hmmed. “They really take security seriously here, don’t they?” 

“It’s a real problem,” Jake admitted. He slotted a mage crystal into his staff. 

“Are you going to break through the door?” Julia asked. 

“No,” said the wizard. “If it’s like the last door it’ll be six inches thick, with layers of silver and iron mixed in with the steel. More importantly, there’s a good chance it would set off an alarm or some kind of automated defense.”

“I’m not sure blowing a hole in the wall would be better,” Julia pointed out. 

“I’m not blowing holes in anything,” Jake told her. He leveled his staff at the security console. His will touched the mage crystal, guiding the power through a specific set of ruins. “Open sesame.” 

The unlocking spell was a complicated working. The difficulty of the spell scaled with the quality of the lock. A simple padlock was easy. A high tech safe was a lot harder. An alien security console would be a real bitch. 

Fortunately, Jake didn’t have to get it right on the first try. The spell wouldn’t do anything until he found the right combination. He cast the spell continuously, sifting through probabilities as rapidly as he could. It was the magical equivalent of brute force hacking. It took two small sized crystals and twenty minutes, but Jake opened the door without setting off any alarms.

The window in the next corridor revealed a human. A dead one. 

Jake looked closer. The corpse was shriveled. Almost mummified. The body was too withered to determine age or gender, but the remains of a black skirt and fishnet stockings suggested it had been female. Jake gritted his teeth. He was about to move on when the dead girl moved. 

“Did you see that?” asked Julia. 

“I saw,” said Jake. He tried to open the door. It was locked. Jake wasted ten minutes trying to unlock the stupid thing before he realized the device to unlock it was a biometric scanner. No spell of his was getting through that. 

To hell with it. Jake was tired of sneaking around anyway. He gripped his staff with both hands and channeled some power into it. He swung the staff like a baseball bat, hitting the glass with five times the force he could produce with his body alone. 

His staff bounced off the window so hard he lost his grip on it. 

“I can see why you didn’t try to break the door down,” Julia quipped. 

Jake ignored her. He drew his shortsword. He grimaced as he slotted in another mage crystal. He was running low on the things. Jake used his will to connect, and blue runes lit up along the blade. The shortsword hummed, vibrating in his hand. 

The shortsword also bounced off the window. 

“Damn,” said Julia. “Who made that thing? Space dwarves?” 

“You’re not helping,” Jake groused. He tapped the sword against the window. The enchantments on the blade should let it cut through almost anything. He peered closer. The blade wasn’t touching the window itself. It had stopped a quarter inch from the glass. “Huh. Forcefield.” 

The door didn’t have a forcefield. Cutting it open didn’t take long. Cutting the door open set off an alarm. Green lights flashed. Sirens blared. An automated voice announced, “WARNING! CONTAINMENT BREACH! CONTAINMENT BREACH! SPECIMEN CONTAINMENT ROOM 1343.”

“Is that going to wake anyone up?” Julia asked. 

“Nope.” Jake ignored the alarms and entered the room. “Not til the spell wears off.” 

He examined the corpse. It was on a thick slab of steel table. Its hands and feet were encased in large metal restraints. The body was small. Either a teenager or a short adult. Its head was still shifting from side to side, milky eyes staring sightlessly. Its jaw opened and closed, revealing fangs. 

“Vampire,” said Jake. 

“What happened to her?” asked Julia. 

“My guess?” Jake grimaced. “They took her blood. All of it.” 

“That’s…” Julia sounded worried. “That’s really bad, Jake. You need to get out of there.” 

“She needs help,” said Jake, “and she might know something.” 

“She’s a monster, Jake,” Julia warned. “If she gets out of those restraints she’s going to eat you.” 

“Vampires are people too, Jules,” Jake chided. “They’ve been citizens for four hundred years.” 

“I’m not being racist,” Julia chided back. “I’m talking biology. She’s been tortured and drained of blood. She’ll be a mindless monster until she feeds.”

“Fair point,” Jake conceded. He dug around in one of the room’s cabinets and found a glass beaker. A little more digging produced a funnel. 

“You could feed her one of the scientists,” Julia suggested. “It would serve them right.” 

“Won’t work,” said Jake. “Vampires require human blood. Animals and aliens will just make her sick.” He set the beaker on the table. “Not to worry, though. I can bring her around.” He reached for his shortsword, then thought better of it. Too sharp. He pulled out his silver dagger instead. 

“I’m not sure there’s enough blood in your body to do that,” said Julia. 

“That’s why I’m going to cheat.” Jake dropped a medium sized mage crystal into the beaker, then held his left wrist over it. He made a careful cut with the dagger. Blood flowed. 

“Vampires feed on blood,” he explained, “but it’s really a way to absorb life force.” Jake fed his will into the mage crystal mixing with his blood. “Magic isn’t quite the same thing, but it's close enough you can use it to supercharge the blood. It’s an old Mage Corps trick.” 

Jake bled into the beaker until it was half full. His will dissolved the last of the mage crystal. Jake found something that vaguely resembled a first aid kit in one of the cabinets. He wrapped his wrist to slow the bleeding. 

Now to get the blood to the vampire. Preferably without losing a hand in the process. Jake called up his magic. He cast a quick spell. A band of force pressed the vampire’s head down against the table. The creature didn’t seem to notice. Jake put the funnel in the vampire’s mouth, then poured the beaker of blood into it. 

The reaction was immediate and violent. The vampire bucked, straining against the restraints. The head snapped forward, barely slowed by Jake’s force spell. He barely yanked his hand back in time. 

The creature jerked around wildly for several seconds. Then it stopped. Its milky eyes changed to a vibrant blue. They fastened on Jake’s medallion. “Holy shit,” the vampire breathed. “They sent the Mage Corps.”

“Not exactly,” said Jake. “It’s just me and I’m a civilian now. Are you lucid?”

“Lucid?” The corpse lay back on the table. She closed her eyes, but her voice was clear and steady. Rather pretty, really. “I don’t know. I might be hallucinating right now. I’m also freaking starving.” Her eyes snapped open. “Wait. What about the others?” 

“I don’t know yet,” Jake told her. “You’re the first person I found.” He fixed her with a look. “Are you lucid, young lady?” 

“Young lady?” the vampire huffed. “I’m twenty six. I’ve been twenty six for three hundred years.” 

“Can I trust you not to eat me or not?” Jake asked. He was getting annoyed. 

“Oh.” The dead girl frowned. “Good question. Maybe? I think?” 

Jake sighed. “It’ll have to do.” He waved his staff over the table. “Open sesame.” 

The restraints popped open. The vampire sat up slowly. “Bloody hell. I’ve never felt so weak.” She held a shriveled arm out to Jake. “Help a girl up?” 

Jake hesitated. Weakened or not, letting a starved vampire hold onto him wasn’t a smart decision. Especially while his wrist was bleeding. To hell with it. Jake held out his arm. The vampire used it to support herself as she swung off the table. She swayed a little, but managed to stay on her feet. 

“Oh thank goodness,” she muttered. “I was worried you’d have to carry me.” She looked up at Jake with what he assumed was supposed to be a winning smile. “I’m Valeria. Valeria Laurent.” 

“Jake Mundane,” Jake gave her a nod. “Nice to meet you.” 

“Likewise.” Valeria gave him a nod. She scowled up at the flashing green lights. “We better get moving. That alarm’s going to bring a lot of guards.” 

“No it won’t,” Jake informed her. “Every nurral on the station’s asleep.” He frowned. “Comatose, technically.” 

“All of them?” Valeria stared at him in surprise. “Wow. Ok. Did you take out the robots, too?” 

Jake blinked. “Robots?” 

**AUTHOR'S NOTE:** [The Privateer](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+only+thing+worse+than+a+human) series is getting published on schedule, and should be finished by the end of the year. I've got some time while the remaining books go through the editing process, so I'm trying to figure out what next year's new series will be.

To that end, I'll be dropping the occasional one-shot like this one. You know, throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks. If one of them does really good it'll be my next project.

Thanks for reading! I'll see you all next time.

1o5eepk,all,My journey with the law - I changed my life in an year after learning and applying,"Hey everyone,
I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to this sub and all the friends I made here who have helped me in the last one year. I have divided this post into little backstory (finding loa, Neville and realizing why law is indeed real), m
My learnings, Successes I experienced, and techniques used.

Backstory: I am 27, right now and for almost twelve years of my life I have been ridden with depression, felt lonely and isolated, was victim to my circumstances because of it. Three years ago, I moved to EU from my home country and experienced horrible health crisis, went bankrupt, failed my exams, broke up with my man whom I dated for almost six years and was just practically alone and secluded in my room, suicidal for seven months (all of this happened in 2023 simultaneously). 
For first half of 2024, I was simply putting out fires and in therapy, until my man told me there is someone else now and I failed my finals proceeding with me getting kicked out of my program. I wanted to be a writer and during those days I came really close to publishing my poetry collection and even paid deposit to a publication but it turned out to be fraud and I lost money and my heart was crushed.

This was it. This was the point wherein I decided this is not the life I want to live. Things got to change. I was completely lost. I believed when I was 13 that I am going to be successful, loved and happy in my adulthood and I was completely lost and losing it in my mid 20s already despite living half of my dream of living abroad. 

On the same day (17 July 2024, yes I remember the day!), I looked into Manifestation sub, followed by Law of Attraction then Assumption, then Neville Goddard. I got into teachings of Joe Dispenza, Sammy Ingram, Erik (Power of I am) and most importantly I started reading Bhagvad Gita. 


My Learnings: 

Many people who come on this sub for most part come to manifest something which THEY BELIEVE IS OUTSIDE OF THEM. 
this is the key to it all - the Belief that it is outside of you. 

One of the early most post I read  in Law of Assumption or its application was to 
1. Identify your wounds/triggers. IDENTIFY. 
Identity to know what you believe yourself in the moment, to what you reveal about yourself. 
It's important because it shows you exactly where the north of your compass is. 

“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live. Do not try to change people; they are only messengers telling you who you are.” — Neville Goddard


2. For the first two months, I simply understood and recognise all my negative thoughts and beliefs and worked heavily on my self concept. I created a story , a small scene of talking to a friend on how to heal depression. It maybe similar to Visualization or Scripting but tbh, i didn't do it perfectly but I just did. Key was my own belief that I am someone who can give advice on it and people will believe me because they see the change in me. Meaning i have changed. 

“Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue feeling it until that which you feel objectifies itself.” — Neville Goddard, Feeling is the Secret.

For all the, which technique wonderers - IT TRULY DOESN'T MATTER. it boils down to you and your belief. Your story. The medium of the story is irrelevant. Only the story is. And story can change per the will of the writer, any time, any day.

3. In 2025, I experienced a lot of 3d setbacks within first three months was even more lost. My visa was ending and I was struggling physically this time. I revised all I learned but I go into the nitty gritty beyond the 3d and our desires aspect through Gita. 

I want to emphasize, I have read Bible and few texts from other religious texts, I am from Science background and I believe in God but I also question it's existence and existence of Universe itself but honestly from everything I have read  and studied it all points to the concrete fact that Life comes from us. We give it meaning. Because in truth Life is meaningless, random, and nothingness. 

It's our own thoughts, ego, mind, beliefs, senses which create a picture. As without, so within, so without, so within...its endless.

And Gita, primarily, made me realize that a man is bound to his ego, which binds our thoughts and knowledge, which binds our beliefs and which binds our senses and which shows in 3d. That's all. Once we see beyond our ego. We realize there exists an observer beyond ego. We see god. And we are god. 
And if you look at it scientifically, we all come from atoms. So we are creation of the same unit. You, world around you, your desires are atoms and part of the same mixture as you. 

“You are already that which you want to be, and your refusal to believe it is the only reason you do not see it.” — Neville Goddard

There is nothing away from you.
It's a belief which took months to get rooted in my belief. But it's a truth I return to now every time.

Also, truth of detachment. Detachment is not being unbothered or ignoring or pretending to not care. Detachment is freeing yourself. It is freedom from everything we allow to govern us. Meaning freedom from your desire. The desperation the need the reason of wanting it ceases to exist because you're not trapped by your senses anymore.

It is or it is not but you are . And if you are ,so it it is.

All this learnings led me to my successes:
1. Within starting in 2023, my therapy improved. I made few new friends and I became someone who admired Nature. I became calmer within weeks. Around two months in, one of my friends told me that it feels so much calmer to be around me now. A week later, a friend I hadn't talked to and ended on bad terms with reached out after four years and we reconciled and became best friends again in a month. 
My scene of explaining how depression works and how to heal came true thrice with three different friends.

2. I affirmed that things work out for me as my umbrella Affirmations. And over time. My father's business boomed in early 2024 and he lend me money to pay my debt. It was a huge amount and medical bill. But I received money from my friends as a contest prize for my writing as well.

3. I was lost and in a dead end career for years. And felt shameful of my career which contributed to my failure in masters program. A month before failing I attended a conference on machine learning and it's application in medical fields especially mental health and women endocrine systems and I was thrilled and found my purpose. I looked into it and started studying.

Even after dropping out, I continued to apply for jobs and received two internship. Even now a job in my home country, paying me 5 figure a month and admission to a masters program in my dream city to restart studies this time in a field I am seeing my future in and am more aligned with. 

4. I had given up on writing but I started writing again after 10 months on Substack and now I have over 500 subscribers and millions of ideas to write more and more. I recently acquired an agent as well 

5. My relationship with my man is improving. I realized everything was created by me. We haven't reconciled yet. But yesterday, I found out he broke up. I also realized he is my mirror. Probably the most accurate one. I retraced my memories as I changed my beliefs and I saw him reflect them every time we talked. When we had a conversation last time, I did so to gain closure and to free him to be happy with whomever (it was a bad day ngl). But he proceeded to tell me that he knows this isn't the last time we are talking and our paths will cross once more... and while our paths haven't crossed yet, I know it is going to.

6. My relationship with myself improved. I don't remember being depressed, anxious or anything ever. I get complimented by my people and everyone tells me they admire me so much. I hated sports all my life but now I not only go to gym daily but I am training as a boxer. I live my life as of a boxer with discipline and courage. And this is a big one because, my relationship with food was one which caused me a lot of pain since my school life. I was bullied then over my weight. 

And my refusal to be that trapped girl is what making me work hard and be proud everyday. I learnt about human body and am losing fat and gaining strength and command over my body each day. 

My life took a 175 in an year. 175 because I know there's more to come haha.

Lastly, my techniques:

 Learning what manifesting, life, Neville's lectures especially Faith is fortune, Gita and everything I mentioned. All of them contributed. But personally, understanding what life is? That question opened avenues to appreciate life in small and big ways.

My ultimate fav - “Faith is loyalty to the unseen reality.” — Neville Goddard, Faith is Your Fortune

But practically, 
1. Affirmations, 3-4 personal ones. Short like I am chosen. I am safe. I am grateful. As well as 2-3 umbrella like Everything works out for me. I am all that is. 
During the beginning, I affirmed with a timer thrice a day for ten minutes. I said them out loud.

2. Tapes - I created desires affs tapes. Basically, a. miracles and I recorded myself saying I received it all. My life is magic etc. and then played it all night while sleeping. I created several such each of 2-3 minutes and put it on loop...
Subconscious conditioning is magic. I woke up feeling a different person several times in these years. Almost forgetting what was.

3. Scripting/Visualizing when I am not desperate or want to change 3d. I used to script or imagine when i saw something unpleasant. This emphasized the lack and my need to fill it. So I stopped that. I only script and visualise when I suddenly miss someone or wondered what am I gonna do or be in two three months and I script something inconsequential.

Before receiving a call back for my internship I imagined wearing formals in the mirror before sleeping. Next morning I saw the same shirt on my shopping app and I added to cart and debated buying when I haven't received any offer. But I still did for fun of it all. And an hour later I got the offer letter.
With my bf, I wondered him teasing me that I have a gym trainer when he could be mine too. And it's one of my favourite scenes to think of him.

Don't be heavy on the how and write endless stories. Rather focus on being the character in that story. 

4. Lastly, returning to basics in doubt I have a playlist of all my favourite manifestation videos I watch them as often. I feel grateful every day, even on my shittiest day which makes me appreciate as small as a pretty leaf or even a bad coffee on days. I live my life and meaning I am thrilled by life and what all there is to discover and learn. When I say, I read it all and come to the same truth of what life is, I mean it and you can find it for yourself too.

“Dare to believe in the reality of your assumption and watch the world play its part relative to its fulfillment.” — Neville Goddard

In gita, it is said that Humans primarily operate from two roots. One of love and one of fear.
All beautiful things and virtues are children of love. Hard work is love for the work. Knowledge is love for the wonder. Empathy is love for humans. Etc.

Similarly all negative virtues are children of fear. Insecurity is fear of being left our, heartbreak is fear of thinking our heart is breakable by a single moment or a person, ego is fear of being overlooked.

“No effort on the path of self-realization is ever wasted, and no gain is ever lost.” — Bhagavad Gita 2.40

These all made me realise that it al comes down to fear. So whenever I feel anything I remind myself it's fear. And I ask myself, what's to fear? Is it really something to be afraid of? And answer is always No.

1o424cd,all,Carpooling,"""Beloved!” I called out with frustration. They should be here in the closet! If I couldn't find them, I would be late for work. ""Where are the armored safety plates for my void suit?""

""They're in the kitchen with your suit,"" the love of my life called back. ""I moved them this morning to be sure you wouldn't forget to wear them.""

Well, the love of my life except in moments when she moves my things without telling me. Then she becomes the irritation of my life.

'Safety first, fun last,' I thought to myself as I finished putting on the underlayer for my void suit. I already suspected the situation was going to be a bit more potentially dangerous than Skylar let on, although I thought my wife was overdoing it by insisting I wear the void suit and full safety plates. But as any married sapient can tell you, the words ""Yes, dear!"" will save your life and sanity. So, if my wife insisted on the void suit with armor plates, I'd wear the damn things. 

Finished with the suit underlayer, I stretched all four of my legs to test the fit and looked around. Datapad, Galactic ID, and my pouch of hard currency chits were ready for me to grab and go.

Honestly, I didn't need the hard currency, but it was useful to buy things that wouldn't show up on the joint account I had with my wife. We trusted each other in everything, yet my wife didn't need to know how many tapioca puddings I got from the human commissary.

I don't know exactly what's in tapioca pudding. Probably a narcotic of some kind since humans enjoy consuming strange and deadly substances of all types (I mean seriously, who drinks an industrial thinner like ethanol for fun?!?!?). I know the pudding isn't healthy but it's addicting. My wife just doesn't need to see charges from the commissary on a daily basis and yell at me for eating junk food.

Datapad, ID, and hard currency collected, I took in a deep breath and headed to the kitchen to grab my packed midday meal. Unlike humans and most other creatures, we don't need food or beverages to wake up. We stack energy reserves and only plan daily meal intakes to be polite with other sapient beings during mandatory meal breaks. Left to our own devices, we She’kari would eat only once per week as biology demands.

This is in stark contrast to my carpool ride today, Skylar. She seems to ingest copious amounts of a disgusting liquid called coffee along with any baked goods she can get her hands on every morning, and she is an absolute short-tempered nightmare until both beverages and confections are consumed. 

I paused for a moment as I realized she would be responsible for driving me to work. Before consuming coffee or baked goods. Perhaps carpooling was a bad idea? But curiosity had gotten the better of me, and it was too late now. 

My wife rubbed a claw along my side in a gesture of affection before helping me put on my void suit and the armor plates. Once done, I stood up and looked myself over. Encased in a Shanditech void suit with full safety plates, it would take a supernova to hurt me. 

I leaned over and picked up the two food containers and held them in my claws for a moment. Outside, there was a loud rumbling along with the beeping of a human vehicular horn.

""Remember, she only gets this if she behaves,"" my wife reminded me as she tapped on the second portable food container.

I splayed my front legs in acquiescence, earning a satisfied hum from my wife. I headed to the door and put on my void suit helmet. Activating the exterior speakers and microphone, I opened the door and stepped out into the day.

At the end of the path to my front door was Skylar wearing little more than her Terran Embassy uniform and a helmet. Behind her was the contraption that had so fascinated me, a two wheeled vehicle she said was a Harley. And evidently, the old combustion machine was tuned to run on ethanol rather than something called gasoline. She joked that if she had a rough day, she could suck out some of the fuel to get drunk. She also mentioned that if she ever ran out of fuel all she needed to do would be stop off at a bar or liquor store and get something at least 150 proofs.

This was one of many boasts about humanity I needed her to explain at some point. I wasn’t sure exactly what the connection was between ethanol and mathematical or physics proofs. Knowing what I do about humanity, it’s probably some strange correlation between the number of mathematical proofs the average human can solve after drinking a set amount of ethanol.

In any case, there was something disturbing about a vehicle that ran on a human intoxicant (realistically, an industrial solvent no matter what humans claim). 

As I approached, Skylar took off her helmet and looked at me with a rather annoyed expression. It was at this point I wondered if she was calm enough to drive, or if she required coffee or another human energy beverage first. Perhaps one of those things she called a donut?

“Really, Rak’all?” she said as she looked over my void suit. “We’re just going to the embassy, not into orbit. There’s no need for a fully armored void suit.”

“I have doubts as to the safety of this vehicle, as does my wife,” I stated firmly. “If I recall my research correctly, even humans sometimes refer to motorcycles as ‘donor cycles’ due to their danger. While I am interested in satisfying my curiosity about this mode of transport, I am not willing to put my life at risk.”

“I promised your wife I wouldn’t go over 30mph!” she grumbled at me.

“Right,” I said flatly. “She has observed your desire and ability to go from naught to faster than acceptable on inhabited roads. If I remember correctly, it takes you less than two seconds to exceed 30mph on this Harley of yours.”

Skylar rolled her eyes at me before responding. “She threatened to permanently take away her baked scoladin if I put you in danger or go too fast. Trust me. I’ll get you to work safely.”

“We shall see,” I said blandly. I trusted her and was curious to feel what it was like to ride on a motorcycle, but I also trusted my wife and knew this could be more dangerous than anticipated.

“Don’t forget!” my wife called from the door to my home. “I have GPS tracking on my datapad. I’ll know if you go too fast.”

“Ugh. She needs to learn to trust me,” Skylar mumbled under her breath as she put on her helmet and helped me onto the back of her Harley.

“After the skateboarding incident, do you blame her?” I asked my human friend and coworker.

“That doesn’t count! There was alcohol and a double dare involved,” Skylar responded with frustration. “And in this case, she has already threatened to take away scoladin. There are two things humans take very seriously. All things furry and baked goods. As much as I like to ride fast, I’m not going to lose her scoladin over a ride to work.”

“I see,” I said calmly while taking a deep breath. I hoped the upcoming ride to work on her Harley would be as thrilling as Skylar promised. 

“Besides, we need to build her trust,” she mused thoughtfully. “I figure 4 or 5 times of safely carpooling and she’ll turn off the GPS tracking. Then you’ll get to experience just what a Harley can do, and I’ll still get yummy baked goods.”

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!

This is also a quick reminder that I’m not dead yet. There will be more Haasha, Center of Attention, and Leave No Witnesses stuff soon! Life just got a little crazy at work these past few weeks.

1o1rcgl,all,Abnormality Analysis: Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day,"Good afternoon! This is the eight abnormality analysis, and I thought I'd pay respects to the greatest E.G.O gift ever designed, which any team with two pride sins may utilise to also avail themselves to a considerable swathe of monstrously powerful high-tier Poise gifts. A welcome sight in any mirror dungeon run, and a staple gift going into floor 10 and above, the *Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day* truly is a sight for sore eyes. But this is also a creature in abject and near-constant agony -- if the persistent reiteration of laboured breathing and the hospital theming did not clue that in, then the soft, ragged breaths that seem to undercurrent its fight sure will. So! Without further ado: 

**Visual Appearance:** 

[Hide the Pain Harold](https://preview.redd.it/x12ct5tk9ytf1.png?width=2204&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f88242a43e366371ec867c9c50c46d81ef6ab15)

I've always noticed the skull first, before any other aspect of this abnormality became apparent. Owing to its striking colour contrast - nearly neon reds against a stark black formlessness - the eye is drawn from one end of the abnormality to the end, as though tracing the silhouette of a person's body from head to toe. The dripping neon red visually implies blood - a fascinating bit of visual discontinuity with the rest of the abnormality's themes, which primarily concern agonies which are less physically apparent. 

Think of this - an aching pain in the chest, laboured breaths, and an insistence on penitence for old wounds which skin has long since closed over - none of this is particularly visual. This abnormality's efficacy in its themes is primarily auditory, if anything, even going so far as to disrupt Outis' abnormality log with the physical presence of its ragged breaths. Even other abnormalities which heavily relied on non-visual cues to inform their themes do not intrude into the format of the log itself: think of the Blubbering Toad, whose cries are central to not only its iconography, but its mirror dungeon event and E.G.Os... but are only passively described. 

All this to say - the visual design of this abnormality is tasked with solving a fascinating problem: how does one communicate a non-visible pain in an image? The dripping crimson, highlighted by the sole-light source on the Abnormality's body exuding from the skull's interior, calls to mind blood, certainly - but also perhaps the manner in which one's vision flashes red under extreme duress. 

The skeletal construction of the Sleeping Bag winds down a pitch-black spine to the central cavity of its form, where the startlingly ordinary form of a man sits. It's rather nondescript, even down to plain dress, but the dotted glow of red eyes visually connects him to the lamplight crimson of the skull above him.

The curved protrusions which swathe the central figure jut out in even arcs like the procession of a ribcage, the costal cartilage and sternum absent from its front. This formation abruptly terminates in a slug-like tail, evoking the manner in which two legs swaddled in a sleeping bag may bestow some limited structure to the shape. Its colour suddenly turns from a dirty off-white to a deep, sanguine red a little beyond where the visual language of a rib cage ends, thus granting the central body in its entirety the aspect of an unravelled asthma-nebuliser. 

**A Bone-Deep Agony:** 

Thoracalgia, medically, may refer to any number of the myriad origins of chest pain and discomfort. 

The most visually represented is likely the heart: people clutching their chest has such a profound media presence that it's a codified trope in TVTropes - the Hollywood Heart Attack. A numbness in the arm, their face turning bright red, and a hand clutches their chest moments before they drop unconscious and stone-like onto the floor. Pulmonary symptoms are also reasonably common, with worldwide anti-smoking campaigns drilling the memorable image of a chainsmoker belching black tar onto one fisted hand, clutching their chest with the other. 

All this to say, there is no shortage of visual representations of thoracalgia; it's one of the most widely depicted signs of ill-health in every age bracket of media. As mentioned prior, however - this abnormality seems to resist many physical shorthands for pain. There is no chest to clutch; there is no tar to spew. In fact, the heart and lungs are wholly absent from the abnormality's appearance, and the lungs are only *implied* thematically because of the natural association between breathing and the lungs. 

What is here is the skeleton - and, lo' and behold, thoracalgia may also arise from musculoskeletal issues: costochondritis, physical trauma to the ribs, or merely strain. I think it's a fair stretch to assume the persistent skeletal imagery is indicative of skeletal thoracalgia - but hey, why is its E.G.O gift a nebuliser? Nebulisers... Don't exert any therapeutic effects on bones. They're designed to deliver aerosolised medications directly to the lungs. What gives?

Of all the possible interpretations to this information, I'd like to highlight two: first, that the Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day is symbolic of a prescription which treats only the symptoms of an issue rather than its root cause. A patient reports laboured breathing, tightness in the chest, and is given an aerosolised nebuliser. The medicine reduces chest pain, but because the bones are not addressed, the patient is trapped in an endless cycle of temporary relief, the machine of their normalcy half-permanently affixed to their mouth. 

It's noteworthy that the Abnormality's strongest attack is barred behind the destruction of its ribcage. While *destroying* may sound counterintuitive to repair and recovery, the visual stimulus for breaking that part of the body is to open the chest and reveal its core - as though the tightness and pressure associated with thoracalgia is temporarily cured. 

>*It was learned that, upon losing its ribs, the entity begins to prepare a highly fatal attack.*

>*However, with the elimination of its protective skeleton, its defenses become highly porous, meaning that it became much more susceptible to our assaults.*

>*On the other hand, while not destroying the ribs would inevitably lead to a prolonged battle, it would save us the trouble of having to come up with countermeasures against highly dangerous attacks.*  
  
*Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day Abnormality Log 3*

Second, in an interpretation that follows from the first, is that perhaps treating the symptoms is the only available recourse for the abnormality. Some illnesses cannot be cured, only staved off indefinitely. In these cases, addressing the symptoms is not a failing, as the prior paragraph may have implied, but a critical necessity to ensure the patient is availed to the highest possible quality of life. And this isn't without base - the nebuliser evidently does provide the abnormality a tangible relief: 

>*A single breath was more than enough.*  
  
*For the first time in their existence, they could breathe in and out as much air as they wanted without hurting.*  


>*Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day, Mirror Dungeon Event, ""Pick Up a Respirator and Put it in its Mouth"" Success*

Perhaps coincidentally, one of the most famous diseases with no present cure impacts the spinal column and nerves, leading to difficulty breathing, and involves a treatment historically associated with both laborious processes and heavy machinery:

Polio.

**The Iron Lung:** 

The Iron Lung was invented in 1928 by Professors Louis Drinker and Louis Shaw at Harvard University as an artificial respirator, which used negative pressure to force air in and out of a patient's lungs. During the 1940s and extending into the mid 1950s, the continental polio epidemic brought this invention into the forefront of the population's minds, with hospital wards lined end to end with thousands of Iron Lungs and their patients. 

[Polio Ward Circa 1950s. ](https://preview.redd.it/23xsn96kpytf1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=894c5a51635035990e3c883db3a0ed4bd9761244)

During this time, it became symbolic of many contrasting themes - positively, one could view it as a symbol of humanity's resilience, determination to live, and the medical ingenuity that allows our species to overcome devastation in any form; however, what stuck to the minds of the populace was its bulk - its scale and weight, and the claustrophobic implication of its interior. Indeed, the Iron Lung has, perhaps unfairly, become a symbol of medical dependency - of losing the freedom in one's own body, robbed of autonomy by invisible forces and being trapped within a life no longer worth living. 

Of course - all of that baggage is supremely unfair to both the invention itself and the patients who suffered then and now. Disease is no karmic fault, and dependency is not an attack on dignity. Still, fear does not often take into account sensitivity, and terrifying implications proliferate faster than measured discourse may control. It was during this time too that the ability to ambulate became emphasized as a signifier of autonomy, as evidenced by the memoirs of survivors.

>*""Every time a doctor came by he would ask me to try sitting up in bed without using my arms. This seemed to have some special significance.""*

>*- Autobiography of Polio Survivor Richard Lloyd Daggett.* 

Muscular paralysis, a consequence of Polio, became somewhat synonymous with the claustrophobic interior of the iron lung. 

>*""That night my legs began to ache, and shortly after midnight I started to have trouble sitting up. I needed to urinate and I could see a urinal on the nightstand next to my bed. I tried to reach for it but my arms wouldn’t cooperate. With great effort I finally reached it but I was completely exhausted.""*

>*- Autobiography of Polio Survivor Richard Lloyd Daggett.* 

This special emphasis on the arms and legs as signifiers of autonomy and movement may be why the Sleeping Bag as a whole lacks any extremities, its skeletal body featuring just the ribcage without any of the structure necessary to support limbs. It's as if to emphasize its sense of helplessness, or perhaps the helplessness that one might erroneously assume always comes with dependency - a creature born not necessarily from the experience of being hooked up to a machine for the sustenance of life, but the fear of it.

We've spent much time discussing the visual symbolism of the Sleeping Bag's shell - the metal ribs enclosing the empty chest of a great and laboured machine. But as Outis notes in the abnormality's logs: 

>*In the process of analyzing this foe, we were able to identify a dark entity of humanoid figure within its body(Heavy breathing). While its exact functions are yet to be identified, our current assumption leads us to believe that it may be the entity’s main form, or its core.*

>*Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day Abnormality Log 1*

The patient is the central focus of this abnormality - or it should be, anyhows. It's a reminder, perhaps, that the central interest in medicine is not how unwieldy or strange a machine might be, or what limitations modern medicine imposes on our ability to cure patients. Health is a humanitarian goal, with the emphasis specifically on the *person.* There is a man within that great and terrifying sleeping bag, whose suffering is real, even as the machine's droning hum drowns his laboured breaths. Perhaps the abnormality, then, seeks to abstractly remind the viewer of personhood - to keep the identity of the patient in mind rather than viewing them as an object of their illness. 

**So Why the Bygone Days?** 

Thus far this analysis has focused extensively on the *sleeping bag* portion of the abnormality's theming, but that's only half the words in its title numerically. So, as the subheader asks - *why the bygone days?* 

Directly, a bygone day invokes a suggestion of the distant past, but it also conjures the idea of an abandoned or no longer feasible style of existence. 'Those were the days' - a lifestyle is no longer available; 'where have the days gone?' - a joyful period of one's line has slipped through one's fingers.

 'A bygone day' - then, might indicate that the abnormality has *given up* a past practice out of necessity.  An immediate connection can be drawn between the medical theming and the name, therefore, as symbolic of a past activity or ability made impossible by the constricting machines which burden the body. The specific focus on walking and reaching in the polio memoirs might emphasize here the vertigo patients undergo when what was once taken for granted is now a herculean effort. 

But what's all this about... Penance? 

>*The shadow in the skull was nothing but a lingering feeling.*  
  
***Resentment. Penance. All of it, to no avail.*** *So it fades away in silence.*  
  
*All that remains is a hollow skull.*  


>*Sleeping Bag of a Bygone Day, Mirror Dungeon Event, ""Watch"".*  

That line is repeated, word for word, in Ryoshu's E.G.O awakening as well. It adds a strange bend of self-flagellation, of - with the addition of penance - religious or ritualised suffering to an abnormality which staunching seemed to deal with medical dependency and the prejudice which surrounds it. So then - let's acclimatize this repentant bend into the pre-existing themes. 

There's a familiar sensation to anyone's whose dealt with accusatory family members and less-than-pleasant doctors before - or just existed in a highly ethicised society, where every deviation from a healthful body is taken as a moral failing. *""It's his fault he became addicted to alcohol!"" ""If he didn't want AIDs, he shouldn't have partaken in that lifestyle"". ""If you're weak or obese, just exercise more and eat less.""* Even in the more innocent cases - *""You should've worn a coat out if you didn't want to get sick"". ""You shouldn't have played so roughly if you didn't want bruises."" ""This is what happens when you don't eat healthily.""* 

This persistent stigmatisation of illness as justified consequence for an action bleeds into the way patients view their own bodies. The process of recovery is seen not as a compassion and aid to one's dignity, but as a humiliation one must endure - a penance they must pay - for an error in their past. This mindset has led to people refusing to seek help for what ails them, and even the valorisation of recovering without medical help. How often have you, dear reader, been told to *'man up.'* in the face of what feels like an insurmountable suffering?

**The E.G.Os:** 

Beyond Pride being the sin associated with Poise, the Thoracalgia E.G.Os may be affiliated with this sin for the exact reason mentioned just prior: self sufficiency is lionised. People who are self-made, independent of all external dependents, and who suffer stoically and silently to fit into this psychopathic expectation are victims beneath the pride of society - the expectation of it. 

So, with that in mind - how do our two recipient sinners overlap in their themes and narratives with this E.G.O's? 

[Maybe smoking in the hospital isn't the best idea, Ryoshu?](https://preview.redd.it/khwsussn1ztf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=240a65e6f5bb7d64f4f22f4a3495b9dc9e338861)

Of the two, Ryoshu seems the more directly analogous to the discussed themes. She's a chainsmoker, which handily ties to the themes of illness as a moral failing: decades of anti-smoking ads have effectively reduced the rate of new smokers, but the more heavy-handed campaigns have also demonised those who have long since become addicted. Alongside alcoholism, smoking is perhaps the most recognisable and widespread addiction in many countries, with the most recognisable effects. Black lungs, chest pain, and buildup of tar. 

Ryoshu is also fearsomely independent - her taciturn speech and solitary character naturally associate her with the pride described by this abnormality - the sense to keep to oneself about their suffering, and treat that isolation as a kind of personal penance. Recall Ryoshu was also the one to directly mirror the abnormality's event quote, highlighting that she views what she suffers as a kind of karmic test. 

In Ryoshu's case, we also have a fairly solid idea of what bygone days she refers to in relation to the abnormality. If the motherly themes were not well-driven by her two Red Eyes Egos, the Red Eyes and Penitence \[oh, more penitence!\] ID, and her occasional remarks about childrearing... Then Thoracalgia's focus on penance as a central tenet of her past memories certainly emphasize that something very, very dear was stolen from her, and that she blames herself. 

What interests me with Ryoshu's Thoracalgia is that there is such little emphasis on recovery: she's *still* smoking, even! Her body is wrapped in bandages, with the abnormality's garb taking on the aspect of a straightjacket. Belts lock over her limbs, and one half of her face is wound shut by cloth bandages. The half of her face we do see, in the E.G.O's animation, is sallowed with sunken eyes, and the breath she exhales is half coloured by the wafting cigarette smoke. Ryoshu is fully - fully! - focused on self-flagellation here; she's a patient whose suffering she takes to be a justified result of what she has been through. The cleanliness - the relief of the nebuliser itself is nowhere to be found. 

[Nice Claws!](https://preview.redd.it/li389x7k3ztf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2dbc19c53eaddbee51cb8a34a274b5d9494de77)

>*Do you recall the moment when you were allowed to breathe free for the first time? For me… now is that very moment.*  
  
*Faust, Thoracalgia Awakening*

Where Ryoshu seems content to focus on her own suffering - the physical presence of the machine, the prejudice of illness and the twisted pride of self-reliance, Faust seems to represent the other half of the abnormality's theming. Breathing is freedom, even if it is not a conclusive cure; even if what the nebuliser treats is not what truly ails the abnormality, it still provides a fantastic relief to a long-standing suffering. 

As a digression - and I share this with permission - my friend was born with asthma. She was not properly diagnosed until the second grade, where a sudden attack at midnight sent her to the emergency room. This, she tells me, was one of her earliest memories: being pressed up to a device in the bleary dark, and suddenly taking in a breath sharper and clearer than any other she had ever been able to.

 It's something that struck me when hearing Faust's E.G.O line for the first time - that sensation of true, profound freedom when someone is availed to a resource they have been fundamentally starved for their entire lives, whose absence was not felt out of simply being *familiarised* to a suffering they do could have no understanding of. To Faust - I suppose this would be the gesellschaft - the world of information suddenly availed to her, the limitations of a single human mind and the paltry years of human existence suddenly broadened so incomprehensibly that it shocks the body like a fresh gasp of breath after years of invisibly drowning. 

**Conclusion:** 

Disease is difficult to talk about concisely. 

I could sit here and sermonise about how no two experiences are the same, or how compassion is necessary for a better society -  but many a time has the concrete of practice shattered the glass of theory. Reality is the only thing which can properly communicate the experience of illness, and create truly informed opinions about it, but no one should have to suffer the worst that festers in nature just for a better perspective. 

The consequence is that an indelible stigma has poisoned the world's perception of disease and the diseased. The example I've written here is the Iron Lung - how did an invention which has allowed people to survive Polio get plastered with all those unpleasant connotations of medical monstrosities and a claustrophobic life?

1o39vo6,all,"There is no AI problem on social media. There's a social media problem, that AI makes more obvious.","I watched a video about the current state of AI recently, by kurzgesagt if your curious. And I realized something as soon as I heard a specific quote from it. I realized that I think the entire way were thinking about AI's effect on the internet, is wrong. It was a warning about what AI will do to social media. ""Stuff just good enough, will soak up the majority of human attention. It could make us dumber, less informed, our attention spans even worse, increase political divides, and make us neglect real human attention."" This is talking about AI's effect on social media, even though you could apply everything here to current social media. And it would fit perfectly. AI is not causing any of this, it's just making it more obvious. So I would like in this post to address all these issues, point out how they're affected by AI, and really, how social media is already causing them.

""Stuff just good enough, will soak up the majority of human intention."": This is exclusively the fault of social media. The algorithms that sort what is shown to us, do not care about quality. They care about what we will watch, and how long we will watch it. A hundred shitty but long videos or posts, is far better for the algorithm than one very well made video or post, because the goal of every social media company is to keep people on their site, so they can sell ads. AI only makes this worse because it makes it easier to make low effort content, but if low effort content wasn't prioritized in the first place, then that wouldn't be an issue in the first place.

""It could make us dumber, and less informed."": This is partly the fault of AI and its current design. The video by kurzgesagt goes into a lot of detail about this, AI is not good at being factual, and is very good at making shit up that sounds about right. But, again, this issue would be heavily mitigated if social media was designed to prioritize truth, which it doesn't. Social media is the most incredible misinformation machine imaginable, that even if AI dedicated itself to exclusively create misinformation, they couldn't hold a candle to what social media already does on a daily basis. Social media is optimized for attention, and one of the best ways to keep someone's attention is a story, especially when it confirms their beliefs. And especially when you pretend it actually happened. You don't need AI to do this, only an algorithm that makes doing it profitable. Because why automate when you can crowdsource?

""it could make our attention spans even worse."": This one, I'm not sure about. There's conflicting data on whether social media, AI, TV, games, even books if you go way back, lower our attention spans or if we just get better at quickly absorbing information. This is mostly outside of the scope of this post though, so I'm just going to leave it at I don't know.

""It could increase political divides."": Oh man does AI have nothing on social media here. I could talk about this for hours, so I'll try to be brief. There is nothing that has had a worse effect on American politics, than social media. Social media has annihilated American politics, and created two opposed cults that we call political sides. Social media is an echo chamber machine, and that plus the misinformation machine, is quite the nasty combo. It brings people together who all believe the same thing, encourages those beliefs, correct or not, with false information and emotionally manipulative propaganda, and allows them to only engage in the other side when they want to mock them or scream at them. Because of how the internet works, every chat board, every subreddit, every discord server is like an island that only you and the people you agree with live on. You don't have to be around people that challenge your beliefs, you don't have to deal with information that goes against your beliefs, because the algorithm will simply filter those out. Or just give you the worst of the other side to piss you off. AI makes this worse by allowing sides to create propaganda easier, much easier for sure, but again, this wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if the algorithm didn't optimize for it.

""It could make us neglect human attention."": While this one is diffidently made worse by social media, really, I think this is a problem we all have a responsibility for. The world is horrible, and people are horrible, and we do not make it easy to want to be around each other. Many people are lonely, and don't have deep connections. AI is a very tempting solution to people who are lonely. AI will not judge you, not talk over you, not burden you. This is incredibly valuable for lonely broken people, and I don't want to discount the healing effect this can have, but it can't be a final solution. AI does not care about you, and can't really connect to you, and that matters. Real meaningful connection involves someone choosing to spend time with you, out of love, and that will always be more valuable. I don't know how to solve this really, but I do know that social media in its current form, is making the problem worse.

There's a theory called the dead internet theory, that most seemingly human interaction on the internet, is really generated by bots. I believe this is actually quite correct, but the bots aren't AI, there us. We are given points by doing what the algorithm wants us to do, attention, likes, comments, love. This trains us to do what the algorithm wants. To say what it wants us to say. To keep feeding into it, to pull others deeper. This is strikingly similar to how machine learning works, reinforcement learning isn't bound to silicon. AI is just learning to play the game as we are, and now the next bots are here, and we're afraid they'll replace us? I'd say that instead of fighting AI for premium access into the meat grinder, we fight the current system. If this is what social media is, then let it die, and build anew. Hold social media companies accountable for what they've been doing to us for years. Stop letting algorithms optimized for profit control our communication, and build systems that are optimized for truth and compassion. The rise of AI in social media should be a wake up call for us all, that the internet now is not what it was promised to be, that it has been taken by massive companies and used to profit off us all. But we still have hope, to build an internet, that truly raises us up, and pushes us forward as a species.",No-Pipe8243,2025-10-11 00:35:07,196,0.92,63,259,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/singularity/comments/1o39vo6/there_is_no_ai_problem_on_social_media_theres_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1o39vo6/there_is_no_ai_problem_on_social_media_theres_a/,self.singularity,0,Economics & Society,,0,none,[],6457,99,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzpz7j,all,A member of staff gave me their phone number - how inappropriate is this?,"I (18F) have a 15 year old brother who goes to a SEMH school, and I have been taking him in 4 days a week since June/July time. At the school, there are two members of staff who help the boys in at drop off, make sure they have what they need, take medications, etc.

I was confused, and concerned it was about my brother, so I asked what it was he wanted to talk about, to which he replied 'oh.. I don't know'. I said ok to taking his number because it's awkward and I just wanted to go.

He had his phone number folded up *very* small ready to give to me before I pulled up, and when he gave it to me he dropped it casually on the passenger seat so it would look inconspicuous. His phone number has since gone swirling around in the washing machine because I left it in my pocket.

This man is at least 35, is married to a teacher at the school, and has children with his wife. I am 18 and when I first met him I was still doing my A-levels, which I mentioned, so he is aware of my age. 

I haven't reported it, because I don't want to make things weird for my brother - he is sensitive and awkward and doesn't often meet people he likes, but he really likes this man.

I haven't seen him outside since that day, though I deliberately arrived late the two days after to avoid him. My dad took my brother in today and said there is a new person there who helps the boys in.

I can't find this school's staff code of conduct on their website. I work at an autism specialist school however and our policies explicitly say that contact with pupils/their family outside of school-managed communication (email/school phone) is prohibited. His school is independent, but I'm unsure if that changes anything regarding things like that.

I have dashcam footage of the event, so you can hear the conversation, but I don't know how to upload it. If anyone wants to give it a listen to gauge the encounter do let me know how to attach it.

Edit: some important info I feel I should add 

1) if this happened while I was out getting something to eat/walking down the street, I wouldn’t be posting. Still a bit odd from an older married man, but I wouldn’t ever see them again. I have to see the man at my brother’s school every single day I take him in, there isn’t a way for me to drop him off without running into him again. 

2) I am very visibly young - I have a baby face, don’t wear makeup, and I dress young. I literally still get ID’d for energy drinks, and have had my ID declined because they thought it wasn’t right when buying alcohol before. 

3) my brother goes to an all-boys school, ages 7-16, and almost every student is taken in by taxi, so chances of any other young siblings being creeped on by him is slim (not zero as I don’t know every student and their travel arrangements, but there are very few personal cars). 

4) before anyone mentions it: I am the only person who can take him in those 4 days of the week - my mum is busy and my dad has crippling rheumatoid arthritis, and driving is too much on his hands and feet. 

5) my brother is very very sensitive. He very rarely completes a full day at school, and this year will be his last year at this school, and I would like to do anything possible to prevent him struggling at school any more than he already does. While teachers shouldn’t treat him differently if they learn what the guy did, some things are subconscious, and my brother would 100% pick up on those subtle changes",LuckMysterious6274,2025-10-06 23:16:05,187,0.88,47,234,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Teachers/comments/1nzpz7j/a_member_of_staff_gave_me_their_phone_number_how/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1nzpz7j/a_member_of_staff_gave_me_their_phone_number_how/,self.Teachers,0,Student or Parent,,0,none,[],3615,73,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o1k8h3,all,"RESPECT JOHN EGBERT, A THREAD: OR: John is great and basically you're stupid","Hey. I previously made a post, where I was [pissed off to the two thousands and nines](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/1c6793n/ultra_rant_about_the_absolute_state_of_fanon_john/). Guess what? I’m still pretty fucking pissed. A lot MORE pissed actually. *Kicks over a trash can* GRRR!!!!!!!! I need to GLAZE JOHN in a SEQUEL POST In order to feel better. You guys aint ready for this shit.

So imagine this. You’re reading homestuck. You’re at around act 3. And with regards to the Egbertian section of homestuck, you think “This guy is pretty cool, I suppose. But. Wow, every other character seems a lot smarter and cooler and more interesting than this dweeb. Is he just here to be a milquetoast everyman heroboy isekai audience surrogate? That’d be pretty fucking awful.”

To the point where you might ALSO think:

“You could probably write an *entire book* and an *entire official continuation of said book* where his only purpose is to be the grating wet piece of sandpaper that does absolutely nothing but grimace at various objects and pout about everything like a stupid child and people would just fuckin accept that he’s just a hollowed out empty shell and the single most *annoying character* in *all of fiction* where a real character should be now.”

Well. That’s exactly what I was thinking. To the letter. In 2018. By around Act 3. We’re so similar.

Anyway, that perspective is obviously wrong, and the first half of Homestuck goes to very great lengths trying to explain why John is great. Really fucking great. And exactly why everyone loves the guy. Because he’s awesome. The reason he’s the main character isn’t just because he’s the most “normal”, it’s because John is an exceptional person. One of the most exceptional and special characters in the entire series. It goes so far in doing this that the role of audience surrogate essentially switches from John to Karkat during Act 4, because all of his reactions to things happening are the reactions of a mad man.

Nothing about him changes during this period of time. He’s a pretty static character throughout the first five acts. Yeah, he starts out rougher around the edges. He becomes a bit more mindful over acts 1 through 5. It’s nothing all *too* fundamental. What does change is the environment around him, and the information you get about him. So you realize why this guy was always the coolest one all along. And I have to reiterate, John gets revealed as such an *extreme* character that the role of everyman switches to some weird alien guy. I need to reiterate again, John is just straight up not even close to being an audience surrogate by act 5 because he’s off the wall fucking nuts. It's a pretty great feat for your perspective on such a static character to change so drastically from act 1 to act 5, despite having zero big revelations about them. And for you to develop a big, fictional crush on them.

Like, *Dave*? Sure he’s a bit cartoony but I know like 30000 closeted bisexual white boys. Dave is cheap. Bargain bin. If you set the angsty tumblr boy machine on “guy with a crush on all of his friends” you’d get THOUSANDS of him. Possibly even dozens. John is special, and cool. The coolest guy EVER!!!!!!!! Who the fuck doy ou think you are? Asshole

I’m going to be totally honest, I’ve reached a point where I barely fucking care about any of these other guys. Like. Why would I????????

Let’s start with the obvious. Guys. John isn’t stupid. In certain contexts, yes, the boy is braindead. He frequently ascends to lobotomy tier most of the time actually. But it becomes pretty obvious that broadly speaking the boy has a good head on his broad shoulders. He’s plenty clever. Apparently really good at puzzles and riddles. He just underthinks things a lot, because he’s fundamentally a relatively laid back and mellow person most of the time. So it leads to his brain sitting there collecting dust. It’s hard to phase him, and he doesn’t feel the need to think very hard most of the time. He takes life as it comes. Over the course of acts 1 through 5, it becomes obvious just how extreme this is compared to basically every other character. He’s earnest in a way that nobody else is. 

That’s his best part. He’s god damn earnest. You can feel his heart beating through his fucking chest with every step he takes.

At first it seems like Dave and Rose are more mature than John, and are going to have to carry him, but that’s far from the case. Acts 1 through 5 go out of their way to display just how much of a positive impact he has on the people he meets, and how his friends would be NOTHING without him. Not only can he read his friends like books, but he also crucially doesn’t give a shit that they’re massive frauds and lets them know that. To him it’s just something silly they do, and he fully accepts that and loves that about them. He’s been the one running circles around Dave and Rose this entire time, to their benefit, by not even being able to conceive how they could *possibly* hate themselves despite just how intimately he knows them, including the parts of themselves that make them so insecure. Unlike Jade “I know why you hate yourself. It kind of pisses me off too. I elect to ignore it, because I’m nice. Please get over yourself.” Harley. No shade to Jade that’s why I love her.

>!Massive side tangent, I do like how you know the beta kids less well than the beta kids know each other throughout the entire first half of the webcomic. It makes the trolls getting to know the kids better compelling, because despite spending 2000 pages with them communicating with them through people who already know them very intimately means you still have a shit ton to learn. This is most obvious with Jade. You gain an entirely new perspective on her which Karkat is taken aback by but get the impression the other kids find it entirely unsurprising. You learn just how shitty Dave’s persona is with Terezi but also learn Jade finds Dave endearing specifically *because* she actually thinks he’s a total loser. Etc etc. A lot of things get recontextualized.!<

This helped him actively contribute to their identities a lot, and probably went a long way to convince them to accept who they are. Given just how much Homestuck revolves around people accepting who they are, this is *massive*. And one of the most important theses of Homestuck is that irony poisoning is for idiot babies who shit their diapers. A lot of people in the Homestuck universe take themselves *way* too seriously. They are bratty teenagers after all. So John being so good at convincing people not to do that… well it’s pretty much *cheating* I think. The Homestuck equivalent of having your starting hand include all of exodia. So is him being physically unable to be on more than one layer of irony at any given time.

Ironically, John being so extreme with how earnest he is probably contributed to Dave’s self loathing a lot. It’s a pretty major point of contrast that Dave even points out, and understandably gets a bit pissy about when he realizes what’s going on in act 5. John was practically built to be heroic, brave, and uplifting, he doesn’t even have to *try*. That’s just what he’s like. Its *easy* for him. And to get a bit meta, he literally WAS built to be a good hero, and he just doesn’t notice or care. He doesn’t need a reason to do what he does, or do anything for that matter. And look at how he was raised, with the literal platonic ideal of an unconditionally loving father. What useful skills did Dave learn by contrast? Ninja shit? Dude nobody cares fuck you. John becomes infinitely stronger than him nearly instantly by just wandering around with a big dumb smile on his face appreciating life, and that gap in power and relevance *never* closes. Bro seems to have fundamentally misunderstood what sburb rewards. John got the fun quest and Dave got two weeks of suffering for a reason. It's because Dave was conditioned to be a lil bitch from birth and shitting his pants is all Dave knows. If you want your child to be a hero always willing to jump into action give them a lot of cake. The fact that Homestuck is so cynical about the CONCEPT of heroism makes John FULFILLING IT feel MEANINGFUL TO WHO HE IS. And do you know WHY he fulfills it...? HE'S JUST LIKE THAT! He's not fitting himself into a premade hole or he has to to save da multiverse that's just who he is! He's just the right, and the rawest, and hardest fucking dude EVER! He's just so COOL!!!!!!!!

When I first read homestuck I also picked up on some commentary about masculinity to rub salt in the wound. Dave was imparted with some pretty toxic dudebro ultra masculine crap since birth. But it’s John who is better at fulfilling this traditionally masculine role of a main protagonist hero boy, and who the story convinces you *deserves* the title unlike other substantially worse milquetoast hero boy planks of wood that John would quite frankly snap in two with his raw mangrit, despite not exactly being traditionally masculine and not even caring the crap that Dave has been conditioned to care a *lot* about. And all he ever does is wander around with a big dumb smile like a moron for the game to shoot confetti in his face and give him a pat on the head and a big lolipop, unlike Dave who has to suffer to put on his fucking pants in the morning on planet hellmurder and gets kicked in the balls by his future selves. The point of contrast again being dadbert being the literal platonic ideal of a masculine role model and Bro being an asshole from dudebro ultra hell who thought Dave should always also be in dudebro ultra hell. One of the main juxtapositions between our main hero and our main villain. Please use this interpretation that still works fine if not better with June being a thing even if I originally thought it with transmasc egbert in mind to get into several hundred pages worth of redundant, insufferable, inexplicable Junecourse. Be really awful about it. Use the word chud liberally. Thanks. Anyway, life is a lot easier if you’ve been exposed to more unconditional love than puppets jerking each other off. And Dave is too sad and gay to be the main male lead.

This whole “you being actually completely insane doesn’t have to be a big deal” thing also helped the humans befriend the trolls. If he didn’t quickly start thinking of Karkat as “my new best friend who says funny things” I highly doubt the humans and trolls would ally with each other as quickly. It’s also why Vriska latched onto him so fast. Vriska was convinced that she had to do something big and important to “redeem” herself, but John let her know that she *just had to put in the effort*. She wasn’t a lost cause, there is a way out of her cyclical self destruction, and fighting Jack wasn’t even *remotely* necessary. It wasn’t enough to stop her, but he clearly had a big impact on her. 

Remember she started as essentially a middle school bully dripping with insecurity before she tried “manipulating” John and roleplaying as some crappy 13 year olds idea of a femme fatale and then just kind of winded up helping him out a bit and falling head over heels for him. What she calls manipulation normal people (John) call being really cool and friendly

There’s an unspoken, almost accidental maturity to him at times. It's not immediately obvious that it *is* maturity, but it becomes pretty obvious that it is. He doesn’t use the overcomplex daisy chains of terrible logic or get caught up in himself like every other character, he just focuses on what he can when he can. That’s part of why it’s hard not to like the guy, and why he’s a pretty invaluable asset in a work full of ourobori. The man understands what’s important. Unlike everybody else, who are all substantially less intelligent.

Later in act 6 on the frog platform he makes it clear that he’s taken to heart that he’s good at uplifting people and keeping them focused. We don’t see much of him actively trying to be a leader before that point sadly, but from what we do see he’s pretty damn good at it. He helps keep people grounded and focused, allowing them to redouble their efforts. And it’s pretty clear that he likes encouraging people a lot, possibly more than anything else. It's pretty representative of how his mindset leads to boundless idealism.

The advice he gave to people felt pretty damn satisfying when I first read it. Its delightfully self aware for why I like the guy so much, and just in general proof that this stud thinks some good fucking thoughts.

[what a smart guy](https://preview.redd.it/6b5al14umxtf1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1a10c562bf80763f7a04981c79cfe5db9a862e3)

[Have I mentioned that I REALLY REALLY like this guy???? These are SERIOUSLY dreamy things to say to people I think. I am getting the vapors from his presence.](https://preview.redd.it/vn0ph24umxtf1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b1059dce034cec82ce2aa77b895c4e80a13ad3)

I can’t choose from the fucking bangers he told Roxy. There are too many.

A lot of these positive attributes that I described above he shares almost completely with his narrative foils, Karkat and Roxy. All three of them, the leaders of their respective sessions, exist to serve as a staunchly reliable beacon of support to keep things from falling too deep into the aimless melodrama batshittery side of things. I suppose you could say they’re “real” and everybody else is a phony and a dumbass. All you’ve ever wanted is to be fucking real. The pain makes it feel real. Bloo bloo.

The drawbacks to underthinking things that make you uncomfortable are pretty obvious. When push comes to shove John will always downplay his own personal feelings which really isn’t good for long term mental stability, he can be kind of insensitive sometimes as a result of his underthink-y tendencies, he most definitely developed C-PTSD, there ARE certain things that annoy him a lot and he doesn’t handle that with much tact or just ignores it usually, and

You know what? Fuck it. He has sex with teenagers now. 1000 years in the Egbert grimace chamber. Glaze post over. 

So what did we learn:

* John Egbert is a chill guy
* He likes taking life as it comes at him and appreciating it
* He’s the funniest person you will ever not know
* Dirk is a fake weeb who only likes the aesthetic and John is a real bona fide weeb and Dirk should weep in his presence
* You love him a lot
* You longingly stroke a picture of him at night
* If you had a friend like John when you were an asshole teenager you wouldn’t be such a mess today
* He is NOT boring. And he’s a VERY SPECIAL boy.
* John DOES generally fit the MOLD of a protagonist hero boy, but unlike all the other protagonist hero boys that are kind of inexplicably the main guy and have nothing going on for them and are only there because its a convenient POV to have a random white bread guy it only LOOKS A BIT LIKE THAT AT FIRST for John. But you will NEVER be able to afford this fucking white bread, because there is NOBODY better suited for that title than him, because they SUCK!!!!!!!!
* Vriska was so real for thanking John for punching her
* You’re nothing compared to him
* You’re nothing
* You’re NOTHING
* I don’t get the whole “Roxygen is just the main boy getting rewarded with the cliche of a pretty woman inexplicably liking him” because I actually had the exact OPPOSITE reaction when i got to that. I was like “WOW it is awfully convenient that some hot guy who is exactly her type, likes most of the same things as Roxy, and likes her a lot fell out of the sky at the end after she was super lonely and suffered for a long ass time. I can get behind this because the girl deserves it and nobody else does.” 
* Why did I spend half this post shitting on Dave????????
* And basically you are a bastard",harryhinderson,2025-10-09 00:52:39,192,0.93,59,251,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/homestuck/comments/1o1k8h3/respect_john_egbert_a_thread_or_john_is_great_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/1o1k8h3/respect_john_egbert_a_thread_or_john_is_great_and/,self.homestuck,0,DISCUSSION ,who did you expect? the easter bunny?,0,none,"[""https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/1c6793n/ultra_rant_about_the_absolute_state_of_fanon_john/)."", ""https://preview.redd.it/6b5al14umxtf1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1a10c562bf80763f7a04981c79cfe5db9a862e3)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/vn0ph24umxtf1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b1059dce034cec82ce2aa77b895c4e80a13ad3)""]",15828,76,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o3b12h,all,Announcing state-machines: Rust Port of Ruby's state_machines Gem,"Hey!

I am the maintainer of the state-machines organization on GitHub.   
  
Over a decade ago, I split off and maintained the Ruby state\_machines gem, which became widely used in major Rails applications including Shopify and Github.  
  
The gem stayed laser-focused on doing one thing well, so well that it went years without updates simply because it was *complete*.

It handled every aspect of the state machine pattern that Ruby allowed.   
  
The irony is that LLMs started flagging it as ""abandonware"" due to lack of activity. It was just feature complete or technically not possible at that time (like Async).

Now I'm bringing that same philosophy to Rust.

I checked  the existing FSM crates and found they either have stale PRs/issues, or their authors use them in commercial projects and don't want to support the full specification. I wanted something:

  \- With all features (hierarchical states, guards, callbacks, async support).

  \- **Community-maintained** without commercial conflicts.

  \- **Over-commented** as a learning resource for Rubyists transitioning to Rust

The code is littered with explanatory comments about Rust patterns, ownership, trait bounds, and macro magic. (The gem is full of comments for years.)  
  
**Features:**

  \- Hierarchical states (superstates) with automatic event bubbling

  \- Guards & unless conditions at event and transition levels

  \- Before/after/around callbacks with flexible filtering

  \- Event payloads with type safety

  \- no\_std compatible (works on embedded chip)

\-Compile-time validation of states and transitions

**Repository:** [https://github.com/state-machines/state-machines-rs](https://github.com/state-machines/state-machines-rs)

1o53ld4,all,Breaking Down Bates,"1.Carlin Stewart realized the short shelf life of “new baby” content this week and pivoted to her next phase of content… postpartum depression.  In her highly curated, edited, filtered, professionally lit version of this Evan waits on her hand and foot, she pretends to pout while wearing high dollar PJ’s and her feelings are expressed via an AI generator.  The Boutique announced that it is closing this week, so of course that is partially to blame for Carlin’s melancholy… I guess.  We aren’t sure because she doesn’t say one personal thing about the store that was her heartbeat for years.  Instead, she promotes a $14 Amazon dress. Next!  The Stewarts continue to film all night long and we see the bright camera light shoved in Layla’s face as she wanders from her room, to the floor and finally to her parent’s bed.  Zade spends all day and night screaming in the baby’s face… or in to the abyss…either way, the kid just talks really, really loudly. After several weeks of no Layla… she’s back this week to hang on the side of her mom’s recliner for a “home school” lesson, sing at the top of her lungs about her love for baby Navy and cheer Zade on as he struggles through another soccer “game”.  Zade is pushed this week to turn up the cute quota and we see him sticking his butt out and dancing for the camera while an exasperated Evan attempts to get him to focus on the game at hand.  The way they all overact is a dead giveaway that this is scripted content… and it is dark and disturbing when you think of what they are going through prior to hitting “record”. Remember back in the day when the entire Stewart clan would show up from Nashville and sleep all over the floors in the little duplex?  Yea, that doesn’t happen anymore.  Now, Evan’s family has to visit in shifts.  Another sister shows up this week with her family and they all head to Dollywood.  Carlin is fully back at work and has another paid partnership for that water machine.  The comments on the ad go South quickly when Carlin says that every postpartum Mom has a Dad waiting on her every need.  It seems the followers have just about had enough of the Stew Crew and their unrelatable BS. We get Navy Kate’s first professional photo shoot… The pictures are washed out, with weird angles and lots of obscured faces. Of course Carlin uses AI to generate her caption… it is full of words that never made the vocabulary list taped to the wall in the Big House.  The weekly vlog shows the trip to Dollywood where the Stewarts flash their yearly passes and Evan shows off their new 3 seat stroller.  Nothing like an almost 6 year old and a nearly 4 year old being strapped in with their sippy cups.  Anyway, Zade wins a carnival game and we see Layla lose her mind over it in the background.  To appease his sister, Zade tries to finagle an extra prize so Layla can have one too… but alas he only gets one.  With lots of coaching off camera, he finally decides to hand his prize over to the baby, but Layla rips it away from her while the parents try to recover quickly to save the edit.  There’s only so much Evan can do with his magical video chopping and no matter how you slice this… Zade looks coached and Layla looks rotten.  You know a quick way to save this narrative?  STOP FILMING YOUR CHILDREN FOR MONEY. As quickly as possible, they get Evan’s family out the door and checked off the list so they can get back to what’s really important… filming the latest TikTok trends with the other exploiters in their posse.  The Stewart fam bans together with the other siblings that sell their children to head over to the OG exploitation mill… the Big House.  They want to “surprise” Kelly and Gil with a sleepover.  Carlin doesn’t really want to sleep there and can barely keep the grimace off of her face but she muddles through.  They all stay up until 430 in the morning and the camera fades on the Stewarts after about 2 hours of sleep with Zade screaming in the background.  
 
 


 
2.Katie Clark is now 25 years old.  Before wishing his wife a happy birthday, her adoring husband drops and promotes a new cover of an old classic hymn.  After he’s waited all day to rack up as much engagement as possible, then Travis posts for his wife.  He uses clips from the England trip showing that obviously they filmed the entire thing.  It is clear that Travis is back in nursing school… we know this because he is now constantly wearing scrubs.  That means Katie is all alone on her parenting/content journey so she recruits Kelly Jo to accompany her for onsite filming at the zoo.  Kelly helps with Harvey so Katie is able to keep the camera trained on Hailey the entire time just in case she does something adorable that can be monetized.  Back at the McMansion Katie churns out a meal of bagged salad and little dried up steak turds just in time for Trav to show up in his SOUTH College sweatshirt, finally answering the question of “what kind of school is this dude in”.  Katie is a selling machine adding powder to every liquid in their house… even the baby gets a supplement in his juice cup.  These people would be shocked at the taste of plain old water.  The weekly vlog shows up on time despite how busy Travis claims to be.  He explains that he is now in class 5 days a week and in a hospital on Saturdays.  His hospital isn’t close to home, but it is less than 2 hours away. Remember when they claimed a few months ago that school was rough, tough and just a drudge to get through?  Well, today’s version of this school story is that up until NOW it was a breeze.  NOW it’s hard, y’all.  Travis pats himself on the back so hard he left a bruise.  He says they have been doing full time social media for 4 years… wait, what?  I thought he was a salesman and worked for his parent’s church before…huh.  Moving on… he still intends to put out a weekly vlog exploiting his children and will still enjoy his hobby of singing other people’s songs all while being away 6 days a week and spending every waking minute studying.  Katie looks on adoringly and says that by the time she turns 26 Travis will be a nurse… and she could have a 3rd baby.  Dream big girl.  Parroting what they have seen others do on TikTok, the Clarks set up a cart for their delivery drivers full of snacks and drinks.  Katie repeatedly says they get SO many packages because of their “job” and she just thought it would be a kind thing to do.  Except that you filmed it.  And shared it.  And bragged about it.  Katie lands a big new partnership with the same makeup that both Josie and Carlin are selling and once she is all made up, they head to Pigeon Forge.  Pigeon Forge is like the Myrtle Beach of the mountains but Katie calls it “peaceful”.  Travis seems to have time for every trip and event… he’s the first to hop out of the car, camera in hand, ready to film when they head to the big house to surprise Katie’s parents with a group sleepover.  They have to film because surprise, surprise… the sleep over is really a big ad for Target AND that disposable deodorant the influencers are all hawking.  In an attempt to up her engagement, Katie gives away cash cards in exchange for comments.  Tell me again how organic and real this is?
 


 
 
3.Josie and Kelton Balka have been grossing out the internet for 7 full years now, and to celebrate they head to Aspen to eat $90 pasta, $150 fish and stay in a $2000 per night hotel.  This is another work trip for Josie and Kelton is just a prop.  In between changing clothes, wrapping and unwrapping her hair around the pool noodle, applying and cleaning off makeup, and editing it all into consumable bits… they take a 4 mile hike and a 25 mile electric bike ride and Josie films it all.  She makes sure to get in a dig about her “good deal” TJ Maxx Guess brand bag… maybe a little jab at her sister and her impractical Prada diaper bag?  Every dress is a body con dress and the boots and heels keep getting higher.  Kelton fades away in his all black fit, just as he is meant to do.  Dude is there to write the checks.  At one point Josie is dressed in tiger print pajamas wearing stiletto heels and I just… I… man she’s already pregnant…come ON.  Back at home we see lots of pictures of Josie with her 3 kids and in a stark reminder… baby Miles is shown sucking his tiny little thumb laying against her heavily pregnant belly.  Mercy.  Josie is way too fancy to show up in some mega influencer event so the Balkas skip the group sleep over at Granny’s house.
 
 


 
4.Down in Borlando Alyssa Webster has a new set of pots and pans she’d like you to buy.  She shows them off through her heavily filtered lens and says it’s not an ad.  She does tag the company though… so maybe the set was gifted, or maybe she’s just hopeful.  She escapes her suburban hell to head to Aldi where she buys every single fall flavored and themed item.  If you look up the word “basic” I swear you’ll get a picture of Mrs. Webster.  Washed out white pumpkins, scarecrows and word art with some hard ass pumpkin flavored cookies get set out all around her house and she proudly shows it off.  Place looks like the specialty aisle at the local Dollar General.  Alyssa makes it all worse by insisting on showing the decorations through some weird Instagram filter… what we don’t see is… her.  Why is she hiding?  In her ongoing scream for attention she showcases her chain coffee shop drink and the message written on the cup calling her the “fav custie of the month”.  Dang the bar is in hell for what excites her.  Her scream for attention is answered by… the teen barista at the corner coffee shop where she spends her couch change daily.  One good thing about all of this is that it must signal she is officially out of mourning for Mr. Kirk and ready to rejoin the world, right?   Not so fast…after all of that lighthearted fun she reposts an Erika Kirk post and orders her followers to “read the caption”.  She says she is sobbing crying because it’s been a month since he passed.  Alas… the mourning veil is back on.
 
 


 
5.This week we learned that Whitney and Zach took their 2 older kids and her pee stick pregnancy test to Ruth’s Chris Steak House for a celebratory pee stick dinner.  They all passed the stick around while eating beef and then had a photo shoot out front of the restaurant holding up the pee stick of wonder. What the actual hell.  This pee stick is more well-traveled than a Webster kid.  Can we put this thing away already?? Everything over at their house is pregnancy hormones, cravings and talk.  We’ve got 9 months of this mess coming.  Zach even blames Whitney’s pregnancy cravings for his lack of Bates Kitchen content.  He says she only wants to eat fast food.  We’re supposed to believe that just started with this pregnancy?  I’d choose Wendy’s over a mayonnaise and cheese pie too… and I am nowhere close to being knocked up.  His Youtube may be dead… but the spirit lives on as he shares his chili recipe on Instagram… complete with a band-aid on his finger.  If you can get past the grossness of him touching everything with that nasty old bandage, you learn that this whole thing is a big ad for a grocery store and a new brand of Broth.  Of course Jadon is there to “help” (i.e. be exploited).  Whitney shows up to hawk some Prime Day deals and then exploits Lily while she eats her breakfast and slurps down her supplement infused milk.  Whitney is currently selling about 4 different powders along with supplements, gummies and liquid vitamins.  She’s a walking GNC until the camera turns off and then she’s first in line at Mickey D’s.  Zach pulls up in the Denali to meet the other exploiters for their group filming event.  He has that car tent tied to the top of the car.  Y’all… how are they going to squeeze 8 people in that thing?  The roof will surely cave in.  Anyway, his contribution is one crockpot of chili that is a little more than half full…2 inches of which is grease.  Apparently Zach and Whitney take JebJud every Friday night so they can watch real movies that aren’t dubbed into oblivion by VidAngel.  The boys are in the car with Zach, apparently riding in the cargo area and carrying 2 Little Caesar’s Pizzas.  Zach sloshes that crock of chili all over the place while loudly boasting that the sleep over was his idea.  Whitney is sick as a dog, chomping on gum while telling us all how tickled she is and how funnnnn this all is.  She ends up leaving and going home but not before they make their latest ad for a board game company.  All of this was a great cover for the announcement that the boutique is closing.  Whitney never mentions it beyond resharing the store’s post.
 
 


 
6.Poor Lydia Bates has to spend another week creating content in her matchbox sized home while her husband is out and about pursuing his hobbies full time.  She takes the camera along while she cleans the house… and it appears to really need it.  She says she is backed up on laundry and the sink is overflowing with dirty dishes.  Of course all of this is her job, along with fully editing all of their content.  Trace isn’t responsible for one little thing.  It’s their 3rd wedding anniversary… does that mean it’s been 3 years since Alyssa Webster set foot in Tennessee??  To celebrate they are going away for the weekend and Trace attempts to curl Lydia’s hair.  He certainly seems to know his way around a curling iron. The weekly vlog shows them in a cabin in Gatlinburg, just up the road from home.  They think there may be a bear around and this causes Trace to jump at every leaf that rustles.  It must have taken major restraint not to show his pistol on camera.  The vlog is sponsored by a frozen smoothie mix and it takes twice as long as usual because Trace. Is. Concentrating. So. Hard. To. Get. The. Words. Just. Right.  It’s hilarious to hear his stilted reading.  The cabin is about $500 per night and pretty basic, but they are excited to be there.  Per usual with a Bates man, Trace makes it all about himself by finding a way to insert a clip of him skydiving.  He’s in a Medic Corps helicopter with both Lawson and Nathan fully dressed in Medic Corps gear… playing around.  That’s what this “charity” is all about folks.  A bunch of immature men cosplaying hero.  They play putt-putt, ride go carts and a ferris wheel and eat at the famous Peddler Steakhouse.  For some reason, they meet up with Trace’s cheugy friend, that douche-canoe from Parrot Mountain.  He has a new $300,000 McLaren and takes them each on a spin individually.  As Lydia heads off into the night in this sports car with this leech of a man Trace hollers out “remember… that’s my prized possession”…. Mmmmhmmm… possession.  Exactly.  They head back home so they can participate in the multi influencer event at the big house.  Trace and Lydia seem happy just to be included and they are thrilled to share their fuzzy little microphones with all of the kids.  Don’t want to miss any audio opportunities.  Trace ends the week squeezing in one more hobby… a night game at Nyland Stadium.
 
 


 
7.Michael is back on Instagram to share a September recap.  It appears that she kept Tori’s kids while she was in Florida helping Erin, and there are also pictures of her with baby Miles.  Kelly and Carlin both give her little shop a shout out by promoting her nursing covers.  One way to tell that these folks are still painfully conservative is their use of these suffocating covers.  Michael shares pictures from her trip to Florida with Erin’s kids and Brandon is nowhere to be seen.  It’s been a month since they’ve shared a new vlog, and influencing seems to be harder than they had imagined.  Meanwhile, Esther Bates has upped her social media posting.  She shares pictures and video from Graham’s first birthday.  Gil, Kelly and JebJud all went to Arkansas for the event that was held in an airplane hangar, of course.  Esther also shares the family’s trip to a local farm and pumpkin patch.  She gets plenty of shots of herself from the back and Nathan just seems thrilled to be allowed to walk beside her.
 
 


 
8.We all knew Erin Paine was coming back to social media…. And we all knew she would dub the newest Paine baby a miracle…and we were all exactly right.  Erin shows off behind the scenes of their latest family photoshoot and a camera follows her as she limps to the door to greet the photographer.  October 7 was Henry’s due date, and this is the date that Erin shares his newborn photo shoot and officially labels him her newest miracle, surpassing all of the other miracles that ever miracled. Erin says she is grateful to be alive and knows that every day is a gift.  It’s hard to disagree with that.  She promotes Lawson’s vlog from Florida and says every time she watches it she just sobs.  To lighten the mood, she shares Everly’s crayon drawings.  At age 7 she’s just as good as… the average 7 year old.  In what can only be described as a passive aggressive punch to the gut… she shares an unflattering picture of a stooped over Chad, knee deep in laundry and titles it “what dreams are made of” with a kissy face emoji added for good measure.  Homegirl that is just not true.  Your mid 30s unemployed grifter of a man ain’t nobody’s dream.  I doubt he’s even yours.  Erin shows the chaos that is her daily life by filming from her perch on the couch.  Carles is banging on the piano (a chip off the old block), while Brookie dances in a God honoring way and the littles are flying around in a cozy coupe with baby William holding on to the top for dear life.  While all of that goes on around her, she finishes up editing “Part 1” of her Birth Story and posts it to YouTube.  Now she just needs to sit back and watch the money start rolling in.  She’s using Jessa Duggar’s playbook of a multi-part series and hoping for enough money to book a Christmas Cabin with Bobby and Tori.  Basically she had a long, hard labor and was not progressing as quickly as she normally does.  Both Kelly and Tori are there along with Chad and what sticks out like a sore thumb is that Chad seems… agitated.  Unhappy.  Restless.  It’s hard to put into words but the man has anger just below the surface.  Maybe he didn’t want anyone in the room with them, or maybe he thought this would be business as usual… whatever the case may be… he disagrees with everything Erin says and even as she keeps sweet, his words are harsh.  He aggressively taps the side of the bed over and over while speaking in a condescending manner and puts his hat on and off over and over again. It was a tough watch but in the end the baby is here.  He is very early and very tiny.  Erin sits on the edge of her bed and softly explains that in the vlogs to come, she will attempt to explain everything that happened afterwards.  I can’t help but feel that she doesn’t really want to… but she knows she has 7 little mouths to feed and they can’t live on sourdough alone.
 
 


 
9.Tiffany Bates has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  She’s chosen to wear the patch so she doesn’t have to prick her finger so many times per day, and she’s controlling it all with diet.  They leave California to make their way back to Nashville where she says they will stay until the baby arrives.  I guess the talk of them spending half of the year in California only meant the half after the baby is born.  They don’t end up in Tennessee though… instead they seem to be at some dude ranch out West and if that means Lawson is recording another hokey cowboy Christmas song I will lose it.  She shares a ton of Prime Day deals so at least someone is working in this family.  It’s been weeks since Lawson has shared a new vlog and I think they don’t want to hear from folks asking about the gender that they have no plans to reveal.  It’s a boy, as a reminder. They make more goofy reels this week that allow Lawson to be on film shirtless in his tight jeans and Tiffy to remind everyone that she is pregnant. I was thrilled to see comments from people saying, “please buy your husband a shirt!”





10.Bits and Bytes… now that the Bates Sister’s Boutique is closing what will happen to the warehouse full of clothing? So far they have only offered a 20% mark down… Even though they say the boutique is closing now it appears it has been closed for quite some time… No new posts since the end of August and Lacey was the one last employee still hanging around… Kelly has another ad that she says is not an ad this week for her famous  skants….Leggings attached to a skirt. It’s an idea that Kelly can really get behind and even though she says she’s not paid to do these promotions…There is a banner on her video that takes you straight to the company’s website… Katie brings homemade brownies to the influencer sleepover… At 25 years old, she says it is the very first time she has ever made brownies. She has some catching up to do in her TradWife life.




Have a great week friends… It has rained so much in the South that I had to install a boat motor on my SUV to get to work in the morning!

1o0mn1y,all,Took a roofing startup from $0 to $2.2M revenue in 18 months. Here is how I did it and why I made less than a McDonald’s cashier.,"I started a full-funnel marketing agency. When I met my roofing client, it was two guys who wanted to quit their job and start their own company. They had no name, no website, nothing.  
18 months later they hit $2.2M, with $600k profit. Meanwhile, I made less than a part-time fast-food worker.  
Here’s what worked, and why I’m rethinking agency.

I basically built a turnkey marketing department. I handle the entire lead flow + all things digital, they handle the sales and the roofs.

I'm responsible for:

1. Branding, Website, Landing Pages, tracking stack (calls, forms, automations)
2. Google Ads + Meta Ads strategy, ad creatives and management
3. CRM setup, management, automations, monitoring and training staff to use it.
4. Full funnel analytics (Pixel, GA4, GTM, GSC) + automated setup of offline events data to Meta/Google
5. Google Business Profile + Reputation Management + fundamental SEO setup/Link building
6. Social media management with multiple weekly posts across FB/IG/TikTok
7. Logo, Branding, Leaflets.
8. I handled the first few months of the inbound lead calls, before I convinced them to hire a call center.

# Outcome (18 months):

**Revenue:** $0 → **$2.2 million**

* **2024 (Apr–Dec):** 189 estimates - $5,124,998; 44 jobs sold = **$828k rev / $211k profit**
* **2025 (Jan–Sep):** 404 estimates - $14,857,432; 91 jobs sold = **$1.38M rev / $317k profit**

**Profit margin:** 30%  
**Avg job:** $14–15k  
**Close rate:** \~22%  
**Marketing cost:**

* 2024 ad spend $30,684 + my fee $8,500 = **$39,185 total**
* 2025 ad spend $61,871 + my fee $36,000 = **$97,871 total**

**ROI:**

* 2024: every $1 in marketing → **$21.1 in revenue; $6.3 in profit**
* 2025: every $1 in marketing → **$14.1 in revenue; $4.2 in profit**
* Marketing fees in 2025 = ad spend is 4.5% of rev + my fee came out to 2.6% of rev = **7.1% of total revenue**.

**CAC/LTV** = 3.91:1  
**Unconverted estimate value:** $13.48M in 2025 (90.7% of quoted) vs $4.3M in 2024 (83.8%).

# What I did, step-by-step:

**#1) High intent first - Google Ads.**

They had very limited budget to spend at first, so I focused on the people who are already searching for someone to come help them fix their roof - guaranteed high intent, bottom-of-funnel traffic = Google Search Ads. The average price per click here is \~$60 , very pricy and hard to compete.

I built out a website and dozens of landing pages to target the exact searches people were making and added dynamic text data based on searches and location like ""\[search term\] service in \[location\]"". I optimized the pages continuously by A/B testing. I tracked all interactions on landing pages, watched back every visitors session and consulted the heatmaps of common scroll/click areas. Basically, i did all i could to maximize the google ads click to conversion %. Important to note, that I originally went into agency space as a web dev/web designer and have solid background in making high conversion websites.

*In the end, i got the landing* *page conversion rate to \~21%*

**#2) Fix response gap**

Once a lead comes in, its incredibly important that we are responsive. *All phone calls need to be answered, all form fills need to be called back in less than 5 minutes.*

Problem = roofers/home service guys are notoriously bad at pickup up phones. They’re on roofs, driving, or quoting. But if a call isn’t answered, they don't convert and then my client sees that as a “bad lead”, which in turn looks bad on me.

So at first, I took on the role of picking up the phone calls. After five months I convinced them to sign up for a call center service. Better than nothing, but still very weak. There is no incentive for call center reps, I'm convinced that if my client just hired an in-house CSR / sales admin, our overall close rates would skyrocket and the wages would pay themselves off.

**#3) Feed the algorithm**

Now that we were getting lots of ""conversion"" data from landing page forms or calls - it was my priority to keep feeding the Google ads machine learning algo with more data about how these conversions are actually doing.

I coached client on CRM pipelines and keeping estimates/invoice data attached to leads. I then created automations to feed all the data about qualified/disqualified leads, $ value of estimates sold/unsold, etc.

This is makes the Google ads/Meta ads targeting a lot smarter AND gave us fully transparent analytics, reporting exactly what's working and where we have leaks that need patching.

**#4) Add Meta for scale**

By this point we were first for our service areas in Google Ads auction insights and because its a very specialized niche of roofing, there is simply not enough search volume and our budget outgrew what Google was willing to spend. Google local service ads were also useless, as it classifies you as a ""roofing contractor"", but 95% of those leads are not applicable for this client.

We were capped on lead volume of the high intent, bottom of the funnel traffic that Google ads brings and to increase lead flow I went on to expand to a colder audience with Meta Ads. to increase lead flow, I went to Meta Ads.

Here, my strategy is much simpler - reverse engineer what works. I watched over 1200 roofing video ads. I know this number because i took notes on each one, noting the hooks, specific sentences i liked, notes on the script, visual elements, different angles/approaches, etc. I built a whole library of ideas and have been testing creatives based off that, occasionally going back to the Meta ad library and watching some more. Because we introduced Meta ads around the same time that we introduced social media posts, there was plenty of already prepared footage from the job sites for me to use.

This year, Meta ads has been the main source of leads. The quality is considerably worse (95% qualified -> 50% qualified), Because we still don't have an in-house CSR, the time to call back new leads is way longer than it should be, so this artificially brings down the % of qualified meta leads. Although the price per lead currently comes out to be worse, the average ticket is equally good.

**#5) Build Trust and Authority**

Throughout this whole time, I was doing two other things to increase the trust and authority in the eyes of potential prospects. Hunting for Google reviews from our sold jobs & getting the client to film content on job sites for social media / meta ads.

I built in automations for simple review gathering from sold jobs. Every added review is massive for local reputation. If a someone is considering spending thousands of dollars for a huge job, you best believe they are gonna be searching you and your competitors up, yet many other companies don't even any form of online presence so we simply appear more trust worthy and reputable by staying on top of it.

With the filming of content - the primary usecase is for Meta ads, which are the actual money generating bit. And although we do not get direct jobs from social media posts (yet), I think it has a great impact for long term brand building & adding trust when leads research us further before making a decisions. Simply by posting videos from active job sites for 9 months, we got a total of 10k subscribers & 14.2m views across FB/TikTok/IG, all of which shows up very obviously when looking at branded keyword searches of the company.

All these systems now produce steady inbound calls, track every quote, and feed back performance to ads.

# Future Growth

Current bottleneck is the sales conversion, as you saw earlier from the ""Unconverted estimate value"" - only 9.3% of estimate value converts. The fastest profit lever for the client is in lifting the estimate win rate on higher ticket jobs. Our overall close rate of 22% is highly propped up by small residential repair jobs, meanwhile, there is a big loss on the higher ticker commercial jobs.

This is outside of what I can currently help with, so I pushed for an experienced roofing sales consultant to train the team and Client agreed. I want that playbook so future clients get even more from me, a full sales process that converts high-ticket work.

I want to further systematize the sales journey: same-hour follow-up, better roof report/estimate process for the client, maintenance agreements for commercial job retention, etc.

However, before I go any further with this, i had to stop and ask myself

# Was it even worth it?

The company sold $2.2M of work in 18 months, and pocketed around $518k of profit.

My total take across that time = **$16.5k in 2024 + $36k in 2025 = $52.5k total revenue, about $25.5k profit for all of my labor hours put into this**.

That’s **2.3% of total revenue** for building and managing the entire lead engine, creatives, systems, data. Basically full control over their marketing engine and measurable ROI.

Looking at it strictly as an agency owner, **I basically built a multi-million-dollar business acquisition channel for a client, for about the same profit as working part-time at McDonald’s.** Now I have to decide whether that was a smart long-term play or bad pricing.

# So here's my question

Was this the right move?

On paper, it’s a great case study:

* $0 → $2.2M in 18 months
* 14× return on ad spend
* $4.2 of pure profit for every $1 spent on marketing/fees
* Every lead source and dollar tracked to the cent

But in practice, I spent hundreds of hours building and running everything and cleared \~$25k profit. Below the poverty line where I live.

This is only “worth it” if I can turn it into a repeatable offer for other roofing companies.  
That’s where I’m stuck.

How do you even sell something like this? Content ads into a VSL funnel targeted at roofers?

* Do I pitch it as a **full-funnel service** (ads, CRM, analytics, etc.)?
* Do I go **flat retainer, % of ad spend, % of revenue, or profit share?**
* When do you move from “cheap case study” to proper pricing?
* Would you have front-loaded this much work for the long game?

Would love perspective from other agency owners or general business owners.",Moretheevu,2025-10-07 23:46:56,159,0.88,83,242,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/digital_marketing/comments/1o0mn1y/took_a_roofing_startup_from_0_to_22m_revenue_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/1o0mn1y/took_a_roofing_startup_from_0_to_22m_revenue_in/,self.digital_marketing,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],10068,129,,machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o3s7ca,all,"For anyone that's thinking about hiring a personal trainer, let me share my experience so you know what to avoid","This turned out to be a very long rant. TLDR: don't let anyone shame you into thinking you need to lose weight in order to run. 

Some background: 38F, 165 cm, 65kg. I'm in the middle of training for my first half marathon and I've been running for a year. Last year I joined a women's gym with a female trainer (Cece) for strength training and trained with her for six months. She was amazing but insanely expensive but I learned enough to continue on my own. 

After training on my own with dumbbells and a basic cable machine, I decided to join a large commerical gym. All new joiners get one free PT session and I was paired with Broseph. 

First thing was an in-body measurement (it's a scale that measures body fat and muscle percentage). I should mention that I'm Chinese and where I'm from anything over 55 kg is considered very fat. I'm at 30% body fat. 

Broseph asks me if my goal is to lose weight and I tell him my goal is to lose fat and gain muscle to supplement half marathon training. 

This is important because when I told Cece I wanted to lose weight, her response was the goal should be fat loss and muscle gain, the actual weight isn't as important, which really reframed I how viewed weight loss and exercise.

So Broseph then says to me, ""With your stats it's very difficult, almost impossible to complete a half marathon. You need to drop down to 55-60kg.""

At this point I'm trying really hard not to roll my eyes. He has no running experience btw except for a 10k from 10 years ago. 

Broseph then asks me the longest distance I've run so far and I say 10k and replies ""Oh you must be feeling a lot of muscle soreness and joint pain afterwards."" I'm like no.. I don't have any pain. I never feel sore after a basic training run. I guess he needed to find a way to shame since he then says my core and upper body look really weak. 

We finally get to a tour of the equipment and he asks about my usual workout routine. I told him I prefer full body workouts: RDL, lunges, squats, lat pulldown, cable row..etc. Once I mentioned upper body stuff Broseph scoffed and said nobody ever does back and legs on the same day. It's completely useless and I should only follow the traditional bro split (now I know why it's called a bro split). I'll never see any gains by doing a full body split. 

At this point I'm trying hard not to laugh at how ridiculously arrogant he sounds. 

Next we move onto barbells. I've never done barbells before and my plan was to start on the smith machine first before moving on to barbells. Broseph hears this and rolls his eyes and says the smith machine is useless and is only for amateurs. The only way to see real progress is on the barbell. 

Broseph sets me up for an no weights barbell back squat. It's my first time so I'm super unstable and it was a bit too heavy actually. So I'm a little hunched over and he pushes my back to get me to straighten up, except he pushes so hard I stumble forward and he just stands there saying ""See? You have no core strength. You will really benefit from having a trainer.""
 
This never happened with my female trainer. With her when I needed to adjust my form, she would just use a finger to touch and then use words to guide me to fix my form myself. And when lifting heavy, she would have me say specially where I was feeling it to make sure I was hitting the right muscle and also tell me how I shouldn't be feeling. Lots of back and forth communication and I felt very safe.

I set the bar down and turn to Broseph and he finally realizes he's not getting my business and also a bit scared I might file a complaint for his poor attitude and ends with a fake cheery ""If you ever need any help don't hesitate to ask.""    

He leaves the and the first thing I do is check my budget to see if I could afford Cece again. 😆

I'm sure there are good male trainers out there and I just met a dud. Hopefully this very long rant helps someone.

1nzpulv,all,I tried to find Pokemon cards for my son’s birthday. I learned just how awful that experience can be.,"My son and daughter have been into Pokemon for the last year. It started with a few cards I had picked up at Goodwill that were bent or torn that they found in my box of random things. They created their own way of playing and had a lot of fun. I’d played Pokemon Go a few years previous, but had never done the card game. I knew a little about collecting but hadn’t known just how bad things had become. 

We started playing Pokemon Go together and had a lot of fun going on walks and talking about our favorite Pokemon. I was able to recover my old account and helped them create their own. Eventually they talked with friends at school and began wanting to get their own cards. I had seen large quantities of cards on eBay. We paid $30 and got a box of 1000 cards for them to share and go through, all cheap cards but they had hours of fun sorting through and creating their own collections. 

After doing this a few times over the months their binders were overflowing. So we moved into looking less for quantity and wanted to go for quality. This was about two months before my son’s birthday. We had been watching some pack opening videos on Tik-Tok and started watching Coop’s Collection on YouTube. My son was interested in getting some packs of cards to open on his own like in the videos. 

I started to do some casual looking over the next several weeks and found out just how difficult that task would be. I didn’t want to buy from a scalper at 3x the price as money is tight like most households these days, so I started to look into what stores sold them. In the month before his birthday I visited Walmart, Target, Best Buy, GameStop, Costco, found out about Pokemon vending machines at Fry’s, Safeway, Winco, and even cards being sold at Cracker Barrel. I visited dozens of stores, watched hours of videos, joined several discord groups, all trying to get my son his birthday present. I had trouble since I’m currently working two jobs, but would stop whenever I was near somewhere that had them. 

Two weeks before his birthday I found out the Pokemon Center online store had just opened for taking preorders for a new set coming out. I hopped over to the site, and was in the queue to enter. After 2 hours of sitting in the virtual line, I finally entered and boxes were available. I added 2 to my cart, went to check out and hit submit on my order. I was met with the message, “Hello, Trainer! We're completing some maintenance right now, so please check back later,” followed by “Access denied Error 17. What happened?
This request was blocked by our security service.” My IP had been flagged and blocked as a bot account for using Apple Safari to place my order (at least from what I found online). I attempted to re-enter multiple times from multiple devices and was met with the same until finally I got in on a laptop and found out there was no more stock available. I tried submitting a CS ticket, but was told in the end “tough luck.”

I had finally had enough and decided I needed to take a few days off work before his birthday to try to track something down. I received alerts about stores restocking but showed up to empty shelves. The day before his birthday I hit up 7 locations that were getting restocked and was told there was nothing available. I tried all the tricks, to no avail. I even messaged a few scalpers selling packs, but was met with them being out of stock as well. 

Finally morning of his birthday I decided to get up at 5 and hit everywhere I could before he woke up. I hit several locations with vending machines, but there was nothing. Finally I was going to hit Walmart, Target, and GameStop by 10am. On my way to Walmart I drove past Target (not open yet) and there was a line going around the side of the building. I drove past GameStop and again there was an enormous line. I had nearly given up but decided to hit Walmart before I resolved to give up. Alone on the shelf was a single League Battle Deck of Gardevoir EX it came with a few packs to open and one of his favorites, Greninja. I grabbed it and a plush of his favorite Pokemon and ran home to be with him on his birthday. 

All of this to say that finding Pokemon was nearly a full time job. I learned a lot, but part of me is hoping this phase will soon pass and my kids will move onto something else. It’s pretty awful what this children’s game has become. I am currently on the lookout for more cards in preparation for Christmas. I’m hoping 3 months lead will give me enough time to find a bit more for both of them, but I’m not holding out much hope nor putting in the time I did this time.

1o5939n,all,AITA for preferring formula when no there was no milk in the milk bags?,"Hello colleagues,

I (3m, Female and searcher of wisdom) have always been a keen learner. Since I have been preparing to be dispatched earthside, I have mastered the art of suckling. My training and studies were greatly complimented later by the giants in white gowns and blue/pink co-ords (scrubs? Not sure what they’re scrubbing) because I forced the syringe down while demonstrating for them my pure strength when lactate feeding via syringe and feeding tube. More on this later.

Anyway, back in my cave before I touched down on earth, I had learned that there are milk bags that do not have milk in them. Strange, I know. They are rare but they do exist. When I came earthside, I quickly realised that I was given such milk bags. To be perfectly candid, I was quite stoked. I have always regarded myself better prepared than others and took pride in my ability to accept this challenge and looked forward to the mythical energy source called formula. 

However, my milk giver (at least 3m 1d, F) for some reason did not share in my joy and elation and would not relent on the milk bags. In fact, she underwent an absolute milk bag gymnastics. She had water coming out of her eyes every day and night and kept vocalising this word, “sorry” to me. She kept taking these weird pills and drinks and she spent more time hooked to weird machines than with me. 

On Day 3 of my mission on earth, I inconveniently developed jaundice and I had lost 10% of my body weight. I put it to the stress and exhaustion of my newly started mission on earth. However, my milk giver was again hysterical. The giants in white gowns and scrubs used on me and the milk bags some weird clear shield, feeding tubes, gloved pinky fingers, syringes of various sizes over the next few days because at first the giants did not realise (obviously not as smart as me) that the issue was to do with my rare milk bags, not me! I told them in my native language that I am keen to research formula but none of them seem to know proper language. They kept muttering in their native language that it was some policy to not recommend formula. 

When we arrived at this new place called “home”, my milk giver continued to spend all of her days hooked to the milk machines. She kept having water pouring out of her eyes. I tried to let her know that I am keen to try more formula for my own research but my milk giver (who obviously is also not as smart as me) completely misunderstood me. 

So I stopped latching altogether. Then I politely let her know by screaming that the expressed milks were not my thing. I could not delay my research on formula any longer. 

At the start of week 8, I finally started getting enough formula. I have since undertaken great research on it and I am in the process of preparing my thesis which will one day hopefully be published so that my fellow students in the cave can also join me in my academic pursuit of this great source of energy when and if necessary. 

My milk giver no longer has as much water coming out of her eyes but sometimes she looks at me and her mouth turns upside down. I know it’s because every time she sees me in discomfort, her mind rushes to not giving me milk from milk bags. 

Now 3 months in, I wondered whether I ought to have allowed her more time to have water coming out of her eyes while hooked to the milk machines. To be honest, I am perplexed that she hasn’t completely moved on and I wondered if she was also on some academic mission? 

AITA for pursuing my own research and preferring formula?

\---

For all of their impressive engineering, the Elusians had come up with a setup similar to ours at The Tunnel. Nanobots clustered around the outside of a cable attached to the probe, relaying information back to Suam from the fifth dimension. This would notify them immediately if something went wrong, and remove the possibility of us providing data that showed any inconvenient truths. Billions upon billions of eyes in the multiverse were upon us, wanting the answers. I shifted uncomfortably in my nanite spacesuit, knowing we’d be thrown headfirst into a portal with a nanobot bubble around us. 

*Nanite this, nanite that. Joy. I feel so safe!*

Justiciar Colban checked our harnesses, as well as Mikri’s; they would tie us to the Elusians’ side of the portal. “The android’s duty is to snap you out of it if you experience complications from long-term exposure. I trust that Mikri will not interfere in your…concentration.”

“We haven’t done this before, so I sure hope he doesn’t,” I murmured, remembering how overwhelmed my brain felt during portal transit. I focused myself on the nanodrone cameras, where I could see them in AR. “To the watching Elusians, this is how driven humanity is. We’ll look into the abyss and steer us back toward a better future. Maybe then, you can be proud of your creations again.”

“Skip the monologuing, Preston Carter. What you find today will speak for you, so I hope for your sake you discover evidence that will exonerate humanity.”

Mikri’s claws curled with a silent rage, as he looked at Sofia and I from behind an EMP suit. *“And I hope that it will show us how to destroy the Elusians who menace that which they have created. I need the introduction of new variables to find viable probabilities.”*

*“There’s always another way, Mikri. Destroying them should be the last resort,”* Sofia chastised the android.

I pretended not to hear their conversation, and smiled at Colban. “Roger that, sir. Like Corai told us—correlation doesn’t equal causation. Whoever thought *we* did it must’ve been snorting the chimichurri.”

“Hmph.” The Justiciar seemed unimpressed. “If snorting this chimichurri substance is something you are familiar with, are you certain that we should trust you with our complicated machinery?”

“I…” I bit back clever retorts, knowing we had to appease them, “was just trying to breathe light into a tense situation. Thought you’d feel better with a smile. I want this to go well. I’m ready to put this all behind us.”

*“This is not something you have done? Oddly enough, I recall you making ‘lines’ of chimichurri and inhaling them, to show me how organics do drugs,”* Mikri spoke into my mind. *“You told me this was ‘Preston in his natural environment.’ I am inclined to agree.”*

*“That was different. My nostrils needed to consume something green to deal with you,”* I fired back. *“You’re like a big, sad breakfast burrito that fell into a skillet and never got back up.”*

*“Never got back up. I assume this is different than the output pattern for your male genitalia?”*

*“Hey! I’ll have you know those systems are* fully operational.”

Sofia gritted her teeth. *“I’ll have you know I’ll make sure they’re not, if that’s somehow your concern right now! You wouldn’t be the first guy that’s caught a knee.”*

*“Now, no need to be feisty like that. I’m not hitting on you—never was. You’re too boring.”*

*“At least I’m not an uncontainable cognitohazard!”*

*“You flatter me, Fiefs. I’m touched.”*

Justiciar Colban stepped back, giving a mental signal and a hand wave to the scientists overseeing the experiment. “Let’s be done with this endeavor then. I cannot deny that your help was a necessity, but any interference with this project’s success *will* have consequences for Sol. Whatever plots you might consider—don’t. Good luck, humans.” 

The 5D probe itself was a massive piece of engineering the size of a small city, connecting to unwieldy amounts of power sources both exotic and terrestrial; the Elusians were channeling the energy of an entire star—of course, not their own—into the machine with some sort of Dyson Sphere thingamabob. This contraption had enough computing power to make Mikri and his whole network look like a Turing machine. I supposed that was what it took to get a concrete peek into the infinite void. 

The Elusian supervisors warped back to an installation a safe distance away. I locked my fingers, which were sealed behind a layer of nanobots that looked silver and gooey, around handholds at the rear of the probe. We would be peering through a periscope that reflected stimuli through a bunch of…strange mirrors, and could adjust where the camera looked from here. They crashed their 4D portals together with precision, in an effortless display of power—it seemed more casual for them than when the Fakra had done it, let alone compared to our rudimentary Tunnel.

Just like that, we were thrown into 5D space, but our lack of forward momentum ensured that we weren’t spit out on the other side. In an instant, my faculties were zapped by the cascading waterfall of a million pixels, supercharged my senses and coating the length of my tongue. Descriptions of the feeling were nonsensical, and as the extra seconds ticked on, I began to choke; I was drowning in the noise. Signals bounced within my brain without a receiver, a pervasive current of interference.

I couldn’t move or think: I was frozen like Medusa had gotten into a staring contest with me. My mind was screaming and folding in on itself. With a longer exposure, I could feel why it drove other organics mad. My senses were cranked up to the maximum, the lights beating and pounding at the underside of my brain—*yow!* A tunnel. A microcosm. Both were true. I…understood. 

And with a concentrated effort, I could think again. I could make slow movements that felt like they were from outside my body, like I was remote controlling Preston. Shit, why hadn’t Corai suggested we do that for Estai? I would’ve loved to have an Elusian meat puppet. Feeling my lungs burn from the cessation of breathing, I made myself take the deepest gulp of air I could. Mikri had been screaming our names repeatedly, rattling with despair with his arms wrapped around us. I focused on the timer on the AR lens, through great effort.

*11 hours, 13 minutes, 56 seconds. We blacked out for that long? I think I breathed only when I involuntarily gasped for air, but I don’t remember blacking out. That’s a staggering amount of time to…begin to shut it out. I hope I didn’t fry any junction boxes up there for good.*

*“Sofia?”* I forced myself to transmit mentally. The scientist’s pinky finger twitched in response, as if that was the only speck of control she had. *“Sorry, Mikri. I…guess it…took some time to acclimate. Need to…probe.”*

Mikri looked up, and I imagined despite being unable to hear, he whirred with desperate relief. *“Oh Preston! I thought I lost you.”*

*“Nah, I’m already insane. I’m fine. Never…been better.”*

*“You were not fine! I tried to transmit to the Elusians to pull you out, but they said if you could not do this after all, they would quantify your entire species as a failure regardless. That there was nothing they could do for you! They do not care.”*

*“I know that from Corai’s memories. You’re rude to her because you couldn’t view them, and feel how much she cares. I’m going to steer this stupid-ass probe now, for her. This is what she wanted.”*

*“I’ve been simulating my life without you for 11 hours. What about what I want? I want you to be safe! I…had no idea it would affect you this way.”*

*“It’s always been overstimulating. It’s a lot just to bear it: like pressing on in a blizzard.”*

The Vascar floated over to Sofia, jostling her by the helmet. *“WAKE UP!”*

*“Awake,”* the scientist transmitted, her mental voice sounding weak and muffed. *“Stuck. Fighting…GAH. HELP M—I’m good. You…start.”*

I positioned my helmet to stare down the periscope lens, still feeling the tightness in my chest and the exploding watermelon inside my cranium that wanted to turn my skull into a lava lamp. Focusing required total concentration on single tasks, so I decided to stretch my muscles by searching for something easy. A test drive. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to remember who was important to us: Corai had been the only name I’d found readily at my tongue, other than the two people that surrounded me. My memory felt a little fragmented.

*Caelum, where Mikri’s Vascar come from. We helped the poor robobo. CAPAL. That nerd got abandoned at the Space Gate, and God knows where he is now! I hope he got to return to the Jorlen we fixed and live a nice, happy life. Lucky duck.*

I moved my hands over the controls, channeling my own thoughts into the unblinking energy assaulting me; Capal, I could *feel* his presence the way I could gaze at my own like an outside observer. I sucked the light into my pupil, allowing it to filter in by opening a mental gate. It hit me like Fifi *had* taken a knee to my funtimes, bouncing around in my mind and actualizing a vision; it was the same as my past precog dreams, except while awake. I could see Capal, Jetti, Hirri, Redge, and an extremely-battered Dawson in some dingy cell.

*What the fuck?! This can’t be right.*

I tried to ask the vision a query in the form of “Who caused this? What happened to Jorlen?” It seemed to shift within my mind’s eye, soaking up a vast swath of the machine’s power. The word *Brigand* could be heard through multiple voices, and then I saw a different glimpse that seemed altogether unrelated. A scruffy human was facing down a Vascar figure that stopped my heart in my chest: Larimak, who seemed to be at the helm of an army. *Jakov,* his name was. He hurled pieces of a spaceship at the Prince Small Dick, earning a surrender.

The people exalted him as a hero, but I had a bad feeling about him. My eye suddenly burned like I’d been staring at the sun, and my head shot back with a howl I couldn’t hear. When I tried to peer into it again, the void was shapeless; I couldn’t force it to cough up anything more definitive. My features contorted, unable to understand what on Earth happened to our friend. If we ever got out of here, it was obvious Capal and the rest of our pals were in dire need of a rescue. 

Tremors permeated the nerve cluster at the base of my neck, rolling upward into my brain. A deep tiredness gnawed on me, and I slipped into a sequence of microsleeps. *Too much. Needed to get out of here.* I pressed a hand to my head in frustration, having run into a wall from a single glimpse. Even the probe seemed to be able to hardly handle much more, with cracks beginning to run in its shell like a river. Sofia appeared more alert, shooting me a crooked thumbs up and holding onto her handhold for dear life.

*“Capal got arrested. Indecent exposure, I’m sure,”* I told the scientist.

Sofia’s head jerked toward me inhumanly. *“What?! What are you talking about?”*

*“I looked up Meganerd the Brown. He’s rotting in some prison cell, and Larimak tried to take over Jorlen—but some human took over his takeover? I think. Yeah.”*

*“Why the fuck are you looking up Capal and Jorlen?! We’re here to find one thing. You should’ve been searching for what happened to the Elusians!”*

*“I had legit reasons. I was trying to figure out how to use this thing. Why don’t* you *peek at what happened to the gray baes?”*

*“I would if I could! You have more practice at controlling precog moment-to-moment; you learned how at the Space Gate battle. I’ve barely figured out how to suppress it, let alone harness it.”*

Mikri floated between us, his chassis trembling. *“I am…so relieved you are both okay. Having each of you gone at the same time was like my processor had no reason to keep spinning. I wished to reimplement the memory wipe on myself.”*

The scientist managed to paw at his arm through great effort, as my heart also clenched with sympathy for what those 11 hours must’ve been like for him. *“I am so sorry, Mikri. I will stay right here with you for emotional support. Preston will finish the job and we’ll get out of here, and make that a distant memory. We came out the other side in the end.”*

*“Please hurry. I do not feel composed.”*

Despite feeling outright unwell myself, I could see that Sofia was in no state to be handling a straight shot of 5D to the face; she needed time to decompress. I had to step up to the plate for humanity’s sake, even though my entire consciousness felt like it’d been fried in Mikri’s butt oil. I tried to zero back in past the mire, and channeled all of my energy to form a question. With more complications, there was more pushback from the void, and the answer enshrouded in fog was less clear.

“Who is behind the Elusians’ disappearance in the future? Is it humanity?” I pelted the writhing mass of infinity with that question over and over, until I found the soft spot and felt its glimpse pour into my brain.

Capal’s vision had been now, but this one was from the future: *my future,* I guessed, because it felt like I was wrapped in Preston’s consciousness. Because of its later place on the timeline, the details were more staccato and obfuscated. I could see General Takahashi hunched over a holographic display, a tired look on her face. There was a heaviness clouding her pupils, and from within the vision’s snare, I strained for some microscopic adjustments of the lens to clarify the garbled words.

“…have to build a weapon that can kill them all,” Takahashi said.

Those words made my blood run cold, and nearly snapped my focus enough for me to jolt out of the vision. I forced myself to stay focused, but my breathing had rapidly accelerated. Panic coiled within my veins, at the thought that the Elusians had been *right.* We were building a weapon to kill our creators, one that would apparently succeed? Colban was going to flip! I had to see more—I had to know more, to be able to do anything. The backlash of this: I had to protect us.

The scene shifted to a later moment, perhaps in the same meeting or perhaps far later; the static uniforms didn’t reveal as much as the slight differences in expression. Takahashi was shaking her head, speaking with a deep sadness in her voice.

“The Elusians are gone,” the general affirmed, as clear as day. “Killed by their own creations. They didn’t stand a chance.”

My blood ran as cold as ice, and suddenly, my awareness was all too clear regardless of how much my brain was being throttled. The vision vanished in a cloud of smoke, and I was left with a trembling jaw. Humanity…really was destined to kill the Elusians? The answer had been far too straightforward for me to deny it anymore, and this would spur the Empire to unspeakable measures; our banishment had averted nothing! Sol was in imminent peril, once they had a few days to decide what I just saw.

*What is Corai going to think, when she finds out she was wrong to believe in our innocence? Will…even she no longer support us? I mean, how could she?*

The probe hummed with power, its intricate machinery overloaded and threatening to splinter along multiple wires; alarms were blaring. I knew these things had a short lifespan once they took their snapshots, but I needed one more answer out of it! Panicking and desperate, I peered into the pulsating mess that nauseated and turned my neurons inside-out. Please, it had to let me ask this one question before it decayed beyond the point of usage! I hurried to force it out, pumping every fiber of my being into it.

“What happens to Corai?”

I could feel hundreds of information snakes lunge through my eyes, different answers all at once that I couldn’t parse beyond to feel them smacking me around. That collection of possibilities fed me an answer that splashed upon me like a cool mist: Corai’s future was uncertain. It could turn out several ways…but humanity building a weapon and the Elusians *dying* was unavoidable? Maybe there was something I could do to save her, and to convince her to run away.

*I didn’t want to do anything rash, but we have to get off Suam and warn Sol, before the Justiciary uncovers the information I have. I won’t leave Corai. I can’t let her die, and…I have to trust her. Oh God, she might hate us and feel that she put this in motion. Her guilt…*

The probe glowed with white-hot energy as it began to break apart, but I wouldn’t accept that it was time to make our escape. Mikri grabbed me with unexpected force, pushing me toward the portal entrance we’d been pulled through. The tin can had a near-paralyzed Sofia slung over his shoulders, and propelled himself after me with her in tow. I reached out toward the machine with longing, needing more answers. How did I save Corai? What…what was Sol going to do?

The Elusians, seeing that the experiment was about to explode, unblocked the way out. Of course, that was why the Vascar had carried us back to safety. In an instant, we were warped to a point in space that made sense, and my mental gears screeched with rust. I’d processed far too much information, even if most of it was gobbledygook. A tsunami of exhaustion slapped me silly, as the overstimulation stopped zapping my brain to attention. 

As I slipped into an unwanted unconsciousness, my mind was still racing a million miles an hour with the horrifying truths I’d gained from infinity’s eye.

#Murder in the Caribbean

Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has launched military strikes against multiple civilian vessels in international waters in the Caribbean sea, resulting in the deaths of at least 21 people. The president [claimed](https://archive.ph/NwD5Q) that the boats were carrying “Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists…transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.” However, a [War Powers Resolution report](https://www.justsecurity.org/120296/many-ways-caribbean-strike-unlawful/) submitted to Congress offered no evidence to support that assertion—making no mention of the alleged gang affiliation of the victims or any intent to reach U.S. shores.

Even if some of those killed were suspected of gang involvement, nothing in U.S. law allows the premeditated government assassination of people suspected of drug trafficking. Standard protocol calls for the U.S. Coast Guard to intercept such vessels, conduct investigations, and, if illegal narcotics are found, make arrests. Yet Secretary of State Marco Rubio [admitted](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rubio-trump-blow-up-drug-boat-venezuela_n_68b8bfbfe4b06793d89d3293) that in at least some cases, interception was feasible. “Instead of interdicting it,” he said, “on the president’s orders, we blew it up — and it’ll happen again.”

**Sept. 1:** First known strike on a civilian boat, killing all eleven onboard. Later reports revealed that it was likely going to Trinidad and Tobago (approximately seven miles away), not the United States. Furthermore, upon noticing the military aircraft, the people onboard [turned around](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/trump-drug-boat-venezuela-strike.html) and began to head back to Venezuela before the strikes. According to a report by [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2025/09/10/u-s-attacked-boat-near-venezuela-multiple-times-to-kill-survivors/), the military launched several strikes against the boat to kill all survivors.

**Sept. 5:** The Trump administration [sent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-sends-10-fighter-jets-to-puerto-rico-for-strikes-against-drug-cartels/) ten stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico, in addition to three Aegis guided-missile destroyers deployed to the region in August, for operations targeting drug cartels.

**Sept. 15:** Trump [announced](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-strike-second-alleged-venezuela-drug-boat/) a second strike on a civilian boat allegedly transporting drugs somewhere in the Caribbean. Three people were killed.

>""BE WARNED — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS, WE ARE HUNTING YOU!"" Mr. Trump wrote.

**Sept. 15:** Trump [said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lyvqlwdcyv23) “there are no ships in the ocean anymore,” adding “To be honest, if I were a fisherman, I wouldn’t want to go fishing either. ‘Maybe they think I have drugs downstairs’.” 

**Sept. 18:** The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-lawyers-raise-concerns-over-trumps-drug-boat-strikes-b8327a5c?mod=hp_lista_pos3) that some military lawyers and Defense Department officials have raised concerns that the strikes may not be legal, but they “believe they are being ignored or deliberately sidelined.”

**Sept. 19:** Trump [announced](https://archive.ph/faTmO) a third strike on a civilian boat allegedly transporting drugs, killing three. The Dominican Republic later [revealed](https://apnews.com/article/cocaine-speedboat-trump-dominican-republic-e42c255ec0e8d5c2d85a7670d12adfdf) that it had cooperated with the U.S. military to locate the vessel and claimed to recover 377 packages of cocaine among the wreckage.

**Sept. 22:** Trump [said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzgjcg5ghs2t), “There are no boats in the water anymore. You don't even find a fishing boat, you don't even find cruise liners anymore. There's nothing in the water near Venezuela. It's actually strange. You know what that means? That means there are no drugs coming in.”

**Sept. 28:** The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/world/americas/venezuela-mood.html?unlocked_article_code=1.pU8.APvU.1xV5LiqogIhr&smid=url-share) that, according to a Venezuelan woman whose husband was killed in one of the strikes, he was just “a fisherman with four children who left one day for work and never came back.”

**Sept. 29:** The Guardian [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/stephen-miller-venezuela-drug-boat-strike) that Stephen Miller “played a leading role in directing” the strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, “at times [...] supersed[ing]” Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

**Oct. 2:** Trump [informed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/02/politics/trump-admin-us-armed-conflict-cartels) Congress that he determined that the U.S. is engaged in formal “armed conflict” with drug cartels, labeling people who are suspected of smuggling drugs as “enemy combatants” in an attempt to provide legal justification for the boat strikes. 

**Oct. 3:** Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-conducts-fourth-strike-boat-claims-was-trafficking-drugs-venezuela-rcna235517) that a fourth strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela killed all four onboard.

**Oct. 3:** Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, [released](https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-trump-declaring-armed-conflict-in-the-caribbean) the following statement: “Every American should be alarmed that the President believes he can wage secret wars against anyone he chooses. Congress alone has the constitutional power to decide when America goes to war. The President cannot launch military campaigns and invent legal cover after the fact…President Trump’s declaration of ‘armed conflict’ is a dangerous overreach of executive power. If one man alone decides when and where America fights, we abandon the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy.”

We’re currently continuing post-release support with a 4.1.6 version which will hopefully be released as an Open Beta before the weekend.  
  
Today I wanted to go over the basic idea behind the tiered ship design that I’ve currently been experimenting with internally. Please note that there is no guarantee that this will pan out or even make it to either an Open Beta or live, it’s still very much in an experimental state.

# Advanced Ship Hull Experiment​

The premise of the Advanced Ship Hull Experiment is to reduce the number of ships present in the mid to late game, and by doing so, making individual ships (especially capital ships) more effective and important. It also gives us an opportunity to reduce the late-game effectiveness of bypass meta (disruptors) while still retaining a role for them.  
  
This first prototype intentionally goes a bit over the top on some numbers to make the end results more apparent. Future iterations would naturally need to be rebalanced as we make adjustments to economic balance and pacing.  
  
In Hearts of Iron IV, as technology progresses, you can gain access to more effective hulls for your various vehicles. These later hulls are significantly more effective than earlier variants, but you cannot upgrade directly from one to another - at some point these antiquated vessels will eventually become outclassed and obsolete, and you’re better off scrapping them than maintaining them. This restructuring can be done gradually or as a major pivot point, which is also reflected in Victoria 3 when you move from wooden ships to ironclads.

[Not a Stellaris screenshot.](https://preview.redd.it/cxmv6p9r60uf1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=48a8eef3a650a211d4fcd364164e9004ce274491)

For my initial prototype of the experiment, I’ve kept this same design philosophy. For simplicity, I’ve just called the upgraded hulls “Mk. 2” and “Mk. 3”, though that may change. Current I’ve tied their unlocks to existing technologies - the **Improved <ship size> Hulls** techs, which no longer provide other bonuses, and are now available one technology tier above the original ship technology for Mk. 2 hulls and two tiers after that (to a maximum of five) for the Mk. 3 hull. (So Corvettes are currently available at Tier 1, Corvettes Mk. 2 at Tier 2, and Corvettes Mk. 3 at Tier 4.)  
  
In this first iteration, Mk. 2 hulls take twice as much Naval Capacity (leaving their Command Limit usage unchanged), have a multiplicative damage bonus, have triple Hull, 25 inherent Armor and Shield Hardening, some minor Evasion boosts, but have four times the base alloy cost and upkeep. Mk. 3 hulls once again take twice as much Naval Capacity and deal twice as much damage as the Mk. 2 hulls and so on, but also gain an extra Auxiliary slot in their stern-most ship section.  
  
We’re currently restricting high tier Reactors and Computers from lower quality hulls - currently the basic hulls can only support tier 3 Reactors and Computers, and the Mk. 2 hulls can go up to tier 4. We’ve discussed whether this should be a simple across-the-board restriction rather than being solely tied to Reactors and Computers, in which case the Mk. 2 hulls would likely be able to accept tier 5 components, and exceptional “tier 6” technologies like those from Fallen Empires would require Mk. 3. All of this could also have hooks to various civics or ascension perks, of course, but for our first pass we’re minimizing these additional complications.

As shown in the above spreadsheet, this experiment also upgrades Frigates a bit, granting them an inherent damage bonus to Explosive weapons. All of the larger ships move up one “slot” in the Command Limit and Naval Capacity usage as part of this change.  
  
All Capital Ships are treated as if they were the statistical equivalent of Mk. 3, and Fallen Empire ships as if they were a theoretical Mk. 4.

[lol first draft numbers go brrr](https://preview.redd.it/jgr67but60uf1.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60fb3e7183b83bbcf515a1517eeb1720fc938e6)

These early draft numbers do make these capital ships essentially Megastructures in investment, but currently Ship Cost modifiers are relatively common. Should The Reckoning come for some of them, we’ll revisit all of these costs. The Titan and Juggernaut Auras are also likely to end up playing a more impactful role in this model.  
  
It is very likely that advanced hulls will end up gaining Shield and Armor multipliers if the experiment reaches the balancing stage, so they’re not quite as hull-loaded, and may also end up with Reactor Power multipliers. (Which could also potentially eventually replace the tier limits.)  
  
The current prototype does not include any changes to Space Fauna, Bioships, or Crisis ships (player or end-game) but we’ve got ideas that we’ve discussed internally about how we’d end up doing something similar to them. 

# So How Has It Gone?​

The AI seemed to handle the restrictions relatively well (though alloy budgets needed to be adjusted significantly to get them building Titans and other capital ships), but as expected, the AI found an immediate workaround.

[Really, 1809 extra ships?](https://preview.redd.it/w8681afx60uf1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=7391ff7d7baf0949168aa819de802412a163f7a0)

I’ve since temporarily disabled Dimensional Fleet and am running more overnights with the prototype. But we’ll be back for you, Dimensional Fleet. They’re also building way too many Deep Space Citadels, so that goes on the list too.  
  
After that change, empires had around 37%\* as many individual ships as they did before, which is a good first step. But this current prototype is only a first step on this journey - it does not make any changes to some of the other design elements that we need to examine more closely, such as the ease of stacking cost or upkeep modifiers and other reductions, or non-linear production bonuses that scale out of control, and is currently wildly imbalanced. Naturally, any changes to any of those will cause this to need revisiting, but those will be dev diary material for another week. *(or two… or three…)* The Reckoning must come for them as well.

*\* Alfray insists that I mention that this approximates 1/e, and also that he called it.*​

# What’s Next?

​For the foreseeable future, I expect our dev diaries will primarily consist of talking about the further experiments and continued patch notes for post-release support.

**Dr. Claire Bouchard, Canadian Astrobiologist**

*May 30th, 2148*

Science isn’t something you’re supposed to go into expecting wealth or glory. This is doubly true with theoretical fields like astrobiology. The joke among my colleagues was that if we were lucky—if the universe was generous—our life’s work might boil down to a photograph of a fossil on Mars or some biosignatures frozen in Europa’s ice. That would have been enough for me, because it would’ve meant we weren’t alone. That thought carried me through high school, through sleepless nights in undergrad, and into a doctorate spent arguing the efficacies of alternative biochemistries. 

May 27th began for me as any other day. Sitting at my desk with a bowl of cereal gone soggy by a few minutes of isolation, I was grading student papers on extremophile environments—groaning at sloppy citations and poor grammar. On another tab on my computer were the notes for my next lecture about the theoretical possibility of non-carbon-based life. 

Suddenly, my phone buzzed lightly—something I didn’t normally expect this early in the morning. At first, when one of my colleagues texted me *“did you get the signal?”* I had assumed they were referring to something our university’s radio lab might have picked up. I mentally categorized it under ‘something to check later’ and went on with my day for about five more minutes until I got another message from an American friend of mine asking the same thing. 

“What signal?” I replied to both of them, curious about what could have gotten such a reaction from two different universities in two different countries. 

*“We’re getting a signal. It’s prime numbers with a hydrogen line,”* Lenfield texted back. Immediately, the morning’s calm nothingness shattered like glass. I had met Director Lenfield at a conference in Chicago six years prior. He had always struck me as a very level-leaded man—not the sort to go wild over things unless they really deserved it. 

Obviously, I wanted to know more. “What can you tell me that isn’t classified?” I texted back. 

Before Lenfield could reply, however, my colleague in Ontario messaged me back. “Do you have a radio in the house?”

The question seemed ridiculous. Sure, I had a small handheld radio that I brought to the beach every couple of years when I went on vacation, but it wasn’t made to detect signals from deep space. “Yes,” I replied regardless.

*“Turn it on.”* They didn’t list a frequency or give any further instructions. Part of me was sure this must have been some bizarre prank coordinated by Lenfield and Fraser. Nevertheless, I went ahead and found the radio in a closet. Raising its receiver and flipping the ‘on’ switch, I was instantly greeted by a series of seventeen beeps. Then there was a pause. Then nineteen beeps. Another pause. Then twenty three. 

Turning the knob to go to a different channel, I was greeted by the same series of short audial blips. Without even realizing it, my breathing had become heavy. It didn’t sound like interference, but it certainly wasn’t music or language. It sounded like math—clean, deliberate, and unmistakable.

Placing the radio on my desk, I checked my phone and saw that Lenfield had since replied. *“It’s on every station,”* his message read. *“We’ve been getting it for twenty minutes now.”*

As I turned on the television, I found the morning news already going feral. This signal wasn’t localized to just the Americas. All over the world, people were getting it. I saw footage of military ships with their cannons pointed at the sky like they were expecting something to descend and open fire any second.

An hour before class, I emailed my students that I was canceling it for the day. A few minutes later, the dean sent an email that the whole campus was going to be closed for the day. 

I only got through the grading of three more papers before the sheer impossibility of what was happening forced me to take a break. joining a group chat with other members of my field and adjacent ones, we spent two hours discussing the signal: speculating as to whether it really was what we thought. 

I fell asleep that night at my desk, listening to the signal cracking in through my radio. In New York, the UN was meeting for an emergency conference to discuss it. Hopefully, I thought to myself, we’d have some answers by the time they were done.

There was no class the next day either, but by then I’d managed to calm down enough that I was able to finish grading the papers. *“Extremophile Life and Inplications for Biology Beyond Earth.”* The final one promised on its title. Life beyond Earth had always been my dream, but in those moments it occupied my thoughts more thoroughly than ever before.

On the evening of the 28th, just a few hours after the UN conference reached its conclusion, the first grainy images from inside the chamber leaked. At first, I thought it had to be a hoax—some AI rendering meant to prey on the public’s desperation for answers. But then the same crystalline being appeared in another image from a different angle, then another. I must’ve stared at those images for a combined half hour, trying to force my brain to reconcile the idea that this was a living thing and not some carved sculpture. Bodies like quartz glowed internally with warm light reminiscent of a furnace. Two pairs of claws looked more like robotics or tools of industry than anything I’d seen on an animal.

When the transcript followed, I devoured it like holy scripture, pen in hand, scribbling notes into the margins of a printed copy until the pages looked like they’d been attacked by a student with a highlighter. The aliens had a name—the Gifrid. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I read that not only were *they* silicon-based, so was all the other life they’d ever encountered. I never considered myself a carbon chauvinist, but my assumption had always been that as the more flexible and fit element, life based on carbon would surely be the most common. The aliens blew that statement out of the water. When they spoke of their Venus-like habitable temperatures and home planet forty lightyears away from Earth, my thoughts immediately went to Gliese 12 b—an exoplanet in that range we'd theorized for a long time might resemble Venus. 

I was on my fifth read of the transcript when the campus notification pinged my inbox. I half expected it to be another cancellation notice. Instead, I opened it to find the seal of the Prime Minister’s office. PM Marcus Tremblay wanted me in New York the next day to serve as an aide for their follow-up conference on the 30th. I filled out the acceptance form with speed like I was afraid it might run away from me and by the next morning, I was already on a flight.

No matter how comfortable the bed in the plush hotel room provided to me had felt, attempting to sleep the night before the conference felt like a Herculean task. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the image of the Gifrid, beautiful and strange and staring right back at me. After 3 AM, I gave up on sleep and decided to reread the dossiers I was given access to. 

Opening up the Gifrid file, I was greeted once again with a reference image and biological diagram side-by-side. Fascinating though the intricacies on their governance were, I was much more interested in the biological data. The average adult Gifrid was around four meters long. However, throughout their lifespans, they never truly *stopped* growing—only slowed down. The largest Gifrid elders could apparently grow up to ten meters long. On their home planet, Yroc, they evolved as ambush predators—using their glowing carapaces to blend in with molten rock before snatching up shelled prey with mandibles strong enough to crush pyrite. They operated like a mix between a mantis shrimp and a trapdoor spider. With that in mind, their patient governance tactics made a lot of sense. 

What fascinated me most about the Gifrid wasn’t their size or even their alien anatomy—it was their chemistry. Every living thing on Earth depends on the unparalleled flexibility of carbon to form complex biomolecules. Silicon, by contrast, was rigid, simple, and slow to react. To some people that I’d debated, the idea of silicon *microbes* was simply too farfetched to even entertain, and yet somehow the Gifrid had managed to build metabolism, memory, and complex thought from it. Their blood was molten solvent; their DNA silicate glass. It was like somewhere out there, evolution had looked at the rules we thought absolute and said ‘try me’.

Staring at the time on my phone, excitement and anxiety danced through my tired mind. *Less than seven hours from now, I’ll be in a conference with these beings…* That thought alone annihilated any chance of me being able to sleep. Accessing the chatroom connected to Tremblay and the other Canadian aides, I reviewed our gathered questions time and time again. From a pool of nearly a hundred, we’d managed to narrow our attention down to ten questions. Hopefully, I thought, there would be time for the others later. 

When at last the morning sun began peeking through the blinds of my hotel room, I quickly showered and threw on the dressy outfit I hated wearing before practically sprinting down into the lobby and waiting there an additional two hours for Tremblay's escort to appear and pick me up.

The ride to the UN headquarters was quiet. Alexandre Blake—Canada’s defense liaison with the United States—was too busy messaging someone on his phone to acknowledge me as I climbed into the back seat. Ambassador Farah Komarov, meanwhile, rubbed her tired eyes and sipped on a frothy cappuccino. I had seen her profile listed as ‘online’ hours before the sun came up, so I knew she likely hadn’t gotten any sleep either. None of us wanted to waste our words or attention in the car. What was about to come next, after all, was so much more important than small talk.

Exiting the car and walking into the building alongside the rest of the Canadian delegation, I felt like a celebrity who had just had the red carpet rolled out for them. Only instead of adoring fans on either side of the entrance, it was protesters. On either side of me, signs with loud, messy fonts silently shouted slogans. Some were quoting famous science fiction phrases, others made fantastical demands of Tremblay and the other world leaders.

Filing into the conference chamber, I could feel the tension as in front of us, intelligence agency aides were setting up cameras for the Gifrid to see us and, more importantly, for us to see the Gifrid.

Throughout the room, aides from every country in the UN watched the blank wall intently as they waited for the projector to cast upon it the image of our visitors.

At 11 AM sharp, the projector turned on, revealing to us the image of the Gifrid. A few people leaned forward in awe, a few more recoiled. It was one thing to see the fuzzy, leaked images or the clean dossier depictions beforehand, but to look upon a Gifrid directly immediately quickened my pulse. 

“Hello again,” the alien’s automated translator began, its robotic tone echoing through the conference room. “You’ve all had time to look over the files we sent. For this meeting, I’m here to answer any questions you all might have regarding us and to ask some from my own crew.”

“Thivel of Yroc,” began Secretary General Vasel, her tone even and respectful. “It is an honor to speak with you once more. Again, we extend our formal and sincere gratitude for your provision of the files on your species and galactic civilization as a whole. All questions have been submitted by our world leaders and will be asked as numbered, starting with the most common and moving down from there.”

“Understood,” the Gifrid captain—Thivel—typed compliantly, all the while watching us with something like curiosity.

A few nations immediately attempted to speak out of turn, but were quickly silenced as Vasel began with the first question. “You stated in our prior meeting that your people are here to colonize Venus. Our most common question, asked seventy two times between nations, was for clarification on precisely why it is your target and what this entails.”

The Gifrid listened to our words translated into their language before immediately beginning to type out their response. “Perhaps to a species in evolved in such different conditions, Venus may seem as you to be inhospitable,” they began, momentarily glancing up to gauge our response before returning to typing. “However, for most of the galaxy, Venus is classified as a Category 1 Paradise World—a top priority for colonization.”

Venus… Every time I looked up at the planet through my fancy telescope on the hill in my parent’s yard, I’d always imagined a burning hell beneath the surface. I’d spent my career calling that world a wasteland—a failed Earth. Now, listening to a silicon being describing it as paradise, I wasn’t sure whether to feel humbled by the universe’s diversity or ashamed of my own shortsightedness.

After a question was answered, leaders and their aides had to opportunity to ask follow-ups. I’ll admit, seeing the United States president raising his hand rather than simply blurting out was both refreshing and a little bit funny. “My scientific aide wants to know if your kind plan on terraforming Venus,” he stated upon being called on by Vasel.

Hearing this, the Gifrid recoiled like a human would of slapped. “Terraforming?” They asked incredulously. “Why would we do that? Category 1 Paradise Worlds like Venus are perfect as-is by definition!”

“You speak of worlds by category,” began Russian President Novikov, momentarily pausing as one of his aides whispered into his ear. “Could you explain your category system? What category would Earth be within it?”

“Worlds are categorized from one to five based on habitability,” explained Thivel, momentarily fiddling with their computer until a graphic came up depicting five worlds. Zooming in on the first, its features heavily resembled Venus. “Category 1 are ideal paradises requiring no modification. Category 2 are nascent paradises, needing perhaps a century of cultivation. Category 3s can be fixed into something livable, but seldom ideal. Category 4s require centuries of advanced terraforming, and only if the planet has rare resources do we even attempt it.” 

Then he came to the last image—one of a planet that looked like a less green Earth; ocean and all. “Category 5s are viewed as ‘hell worlds’—they would take millennia to terraform into usefulness and are generally considered not worth the effort. This is the category of your Earth.”

Shortly thereafter, the French Prime Minister spoke up. “Has any other category five world produced an intelligent species before?” He asked.

“Not as far as we know,” Thivel replied. “We’ve never found radio signals suggesting civilization coming from any world like this. You and your planet are truly an anomaly in that respect.”

For a moment, the chamber fell silent as world leaders contemplated the sheer weight of what had just been said. Humanity wasn’t alone, but it was unique: and in some ways that was even scarier.

Clearing her throat to silence the whispers, Vasel gestured across the table to the Japanese Prime Minister, who briefly conferred with the woman beside him before speaking up. “Your dossier mentioned that every known biosphere in the galaxy is silicon-based. Have you ever encountered—or attempted to create—life from other chemistries.”

Thivel did not waste any time in replying to that. Behind them, I could hear the vague clickings of other Gifrid—rattling and rapid as though excited. “Sort of,” they replied. “The Rhuvix experiment was a pre-spaceflight simulation that attempted to ‘run’ carbon life. Regardless of how we modified the experiment, however, carbon simply could not function at or above the microbial level.” There was more chittering behind them, and in response Thivel continued to type. “Essentially, the largest obstacle was that carbon cells mutated too rapidly. Anytime they attempted to form a multicellular organism, the slightest damage to genetic material resulted in cells going rogue and consuming the others.”

The conference room rippled around me as scientific voices from various nations conferred amongst themselves. “Are they referring to what I think they are?” One of the South American aides asked me. The description was eerily familiar. 

Finally, from across the conference table, a Belgian researcher—medical, judging by their lapel—raised their hand and was called upon by Vasel. “What you’re describing sounds an awful lot like what we call cancer,” they began, the word echoing between leaders and aides alike. “It’s when DNA damage causes cells to stop performing their usual function and start replicating out of control. It’s a very serious illness among our people: one we haven’t managed to cure yet.”

“Equivalent diseases to your cancer are exceptionally rare among silicon based lifeforms,” Thivel explained. “Our non-reproductive crystocytes seldom mutate without significant damage to the genetic material.” There was more chittering behind him, and the Girfrid carapace lit up briefly in some emotion I could not determine. “My xenobiologist wishes to know if humanity would accept a trade of tissues for mutual study.”

My eyes went wide at the request: the opportunity to study cells from an entirely different biochemistry was the stuff dreams were made of for myself and—judging by how the others reacted—everyone else in the room whose fields even tangentially intersected with biology or materials science. If it were my choice, I’d have agreed without hesitation. Of course, it wasn’t. 

As President Stine and Chairman Lao conferred with their aides, my heart sank as I saw them shaking their heads and casting almost accusatory glances at the aliens. Meanwhile, some, like the Belgian Prime Minister, seemed much more open to the notion. After a few minutes, the chamber went from conspiratorial silence to near-uproar as multiple leaders began once again trying to speak over each other. 

“Order!” Vasel shouted over them, silencing the world leaders as she turned to face Thivel onscreen. “Your request is generous, but it has very serious implications for Earth’s safety,” she began. “We will have to discuss that at a later date.”

Thivel’s carapace blinked in what I assumed was affirmation. “Of course,” they typed respectfully. “For now, shall we move on to other inquiries within the chamber?”",Maxton1811,2025-10-06 23:11:57,473,1.0,31,504,text,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,/r/HFY/comments/1nzpv2y/the_impossible_planet_7/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nzpv2y/the_impossible_planet_7/,self.HFY,0,OC,Human,0,none,"[""https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mosq48/the_impossible_planet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)...[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nuq0ag/the_impossible_planet_6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)...[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o30ju4/the_impossible_planet_8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)""]",19061,23,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzqnim,all,Welcome to UCSD. Some pointers and heads-up:,"Reading a single week of the campus crime log will rip the adhesive bandage off the mirage that UCSD is just a bunch of studious STEM nerds and will reveal the seething David Lynchian Blue Velvet/Twin Peaks reality of crime, perversion, and insanity that festers underneath the surface.  The chance is not 0% that you will appear in the crime log before you leave this cauldron of iniquity once and for all years into the future.

The plaza by the trolley station is for visitors to get boutique Bird Rock coffee, play the steel marimba, and start their expedition to steal your scooter.

Your residence hall will suck. When you switch later, the new one will suck even worse. As you cycle through every single residence hall and somehow end up in your original one, each one will suck worse than the previous one like an endless M.C. Escher recursive Möbius strip of suckiness. There is no escape. Better to camp in the canyon with the raccoons.

The tall, blinking tower in the middle of Ridge Walk is an art installation that spells out ""Cole$law don't $urf"" in Morse code.

If you're concerned about the latest flu or COVID surge, join the Main gym fencing club – masks, gloves, and if anyone comes within six feet of you, you stab them. Legally.

The sign across from the trolley station since 2022 that says that that Mexican restaurant is ""Coming Soon"" was written by a geologist.

If it's in Price Center and everyone likes it, it will be shut down.

If you don't have time for any of the gyms on campus, running the gantlet down Library Walk and avoiding eye contact with the cultists is great cardio.  They will try to lure you in with free yogurt and pizza.  Think of the witch in Hansel and Gretel and keep going.

Mother raccoons with their kits do not want you to pet their babies.  They will rip you to shreds if they think you're a threat.  It doesn't matter if you kitchy-coo them in that little girl babydoll Disney princess voice that works on Daddy and fraternity boys.

Campus police are there when you don't want them and they're not when you do. The second most dangerous place on campus is between them and Burger King. The most dangerous place is near Coleslaw's car after cocktail hour.

Other hazardous locations on campus include construction sites, bike paths, and the back of any computer lab.  Keep your eyes and ears open for the first two; bring a gas mask for the last one.

Skid Row Santa thinks it's cute how Starbucks gives names to their free items at the pick-up counter.  Today he had a vanilla latte named Rajiv and a double-smoked bacon sandwich named Bob.

Leaving your clothes unattended for ten minutes in your dorm laundry room is a good way to find out how they'll look on someone else next week.

Sun God Festival is a music event in the spring for you to get ejected for being criminally drunk and to end up with an arrest record and badly sunburned. Unless Machiavelli von Coleslaw cancels it. Your fees will not be reduced in either case.

Inside every COGS lecturer is a lion, an ass, an eagle, a bear, and a pig; and you never know which one is going to show up.

The gliderport is an Edenic location on the cliffs above the beach where you can bask in the ocean sunset as paragliders float on the breeze and the gliderport pervert masturbates in his van.  It's not clear if his van is only a masturbation van or if it's also a murder van.

If you get accosted by a Library Walk cultist, you can say ""I'm allergic to nuts"" and keep walking.

If you came here from Texas or Florida, local ordinance lets you put your high school diploma from there on your dashboard so you can park in handicapped spots.

If you came here from Texas or Florida, ""ordinance"" is another word for ""law"".

No one ever found out who left that axe in that Canyonview Aquatics locker or what they had done with it or what they were going to do with it or anything. That person is still out there. Have a good swim.

Quiet study areas are for you to enjoy other people's crappy music and personal dramas and the smell of their feet.

Nazis are bad people.  Prove me wrong.  (Too soon?)

One-fourth of the questions on this sub can be answered with ""Talk to that roommate about it"", one-fourth with ""Pepper spray is $10 at Target and the bookstore"", and one-fourth with ""Yes, the wifi is really that craptastic"".  The remaining fourth are miscellaneous.

York Hall is a retro mid-century classroom/office complex in Revelle that is favored by the York Hall Naked/Underwear Guy™.  He shows up in the campus crime log about once each month because he's either naked or he's wearing only underwear, and then he puts his clothes back on and disappears.  Campus police have never arrived in time to catch him because it's too far from Burger King.

UCSD is like one of those Final Destination movies where everything will try to kill you all the time.\*  The stingrays will try to kill you. The spiders will try to kill you. The coyotes will try to kill you. The snakes will try to kill you. The bees will try to kill you. The sea gulls will try to kill you. The dry ice will try to kill you. The scarabs will try to kill you. The raccoons will try to kill you if you go near their kits. The raccoons will try to kill you if you don't go near their kits. The Main gym fencing club will try to kill you. The sea lions will try to kill you. Gravity will try to kill you.  The scorpions will try to kill you. The owls will try to kill you.  The acetic acid will try to kill you.  The skinks will try to kill you.  The skunks will try to kill you.  The pollen will try to kill you.  The climbing wall will try to kill you. The discarded hypodermic needles will try to kill you.  The unexploded Marine Corps training camp ordnance will try to kill you.  The falling eucalyptus branches will try to kill you.  The Library Walk cultists will try to suck the soul out of you and turn you into a mindless undead zombie.  The elevators will try to kill you.  The sharks will try to kill you (except the leopard sharks, which are like cute sea puppies, but still stay away from them).  The gliderport pervert may or may not try to kill you. The bats will try to kill you. The ticks will try to kill you.  The swimmer with the axe will try to kill you. Enjoy La Jolla's natural bounty.

(\*Sam's dogs will not try to kill you, because they are very good floofies.)

The newest residential halls are tall towers so you can experience California's earthquakes as Universal Studios roller coaster rides without the Universal prices.

It won't matter who your commencement keynote speaker will be. Weapons of mass death from Miramar air station will fly by repeatedly and drown that person out (they even did that to the Dalai freaking Lama a few years ago, I am not making that up).

Every residence hall has that one person who thinks the microwave is broken because they put in a potato and pushed the pizza button and when the dinger dinged it was still a potato.  That person will be your roommate.  Brain cells will get sucked out of your head through your ear holes every time you hear them speak.  They are likely from Texas or Florida.

Hydration stations are for obtaining fluids, not for depositing them.

If your political beliefs differ from those of the person next to you, you're in favor of genocide. It doesn't matter which side you're on.

The brick walkway with engraved words by the trolley station will snag the soles of your shoes two or three times each time you walk down it, causing your shoes to fall apart gradually over the span of several months.  Because this happens in tiny increments, you won't make the connection and you'll conclude they're poorly-made shoes and you'll never get that brand again.  Thank you for participating in our immersive performance art installation about the perils of consumerism.

Elevators are for making new friends when you get stuck for hours. Unless you're stuck with a stingray, which will try to kill you.

Those large semi-circular booths in the dining halls are for two sticky, squirty people to monopolize for lap dancing.

If you lose anything on campus, it will be turned in to Lost and Found, where it will be lost.

Data Science majors will not graduate until they've appeared before a final review board and correctly said ""Halıcıoğlu"" three times in quick succession.

If you forget to log off of your university desktop computer, a non-affiliate will use their bat echolocation to find it within 30 seconds and they will clog your search history with raccoon porn. Your account will then be flagged by IT and you will be brought up before the Standards and Conduct Committee. Your transcripts will be red-flagged forever, you'll never get into MIT, you'll never get hired by Salk, and you'll never get a Nobel. Log off your computer every time.

You will spend fifty to one hundred hours each year for the rest of your life deleting donation solicitations from the alumni fund. Every attempt to unsubscribe will double the number of messages, like the Hydra of legend. You are in the funnel, you will be assimilated, and you cannot kill the beast.

Have a good quarter. Make good choices!

1o06of3,all,Patent analysis reveals where smart money is actually betting on AI,"Went through this analysis of 2,398 generative AI patents filed globally from 2017 to 2023 breaks down into 6 categories. The biggest category was financial and information security applications at 22.8% of all patents. Image generation and processing comes second at 21.7% and medical applications comes after at 14.6%.

Conversational AI,  the chatbot offered by OpenAI/Antrhopic/Meta/Google etc actually came at fourth place.

Object detection, crucial for autonomous vehicles and robotics, is declining in patent activity (Not sure if tech has matured, or they can't see the ROI anymore). So is financial security despite being the largest category. Image generation peaked around 2021 and dipped after 2022.

On the other hand, medical applications and cyber physical systems are growing fast. 

What I want to say here is that if you're long on AI, the patent trends suggest medical and cyber physical applications have more room to run. The financial security space might be mature or hitting diminishing returns. Image generation looks like it's consolidating.

One last thing, the analysis found all correlations between application categories were negative. What this means is that innovation is siloed and not interrelated. In simpler terms, a breakthrough in medical imaging doesn't transfer to financial fraud detection even though both use similar neural network architectures. So GenAI isn't one market, it's 6 separate markets that happen to use related technology.

If you're investing in AI through geographic ETFs or regional indexes, this ranking tells you where actual innovation is concentrated versus where the headlines come from. Not investment advice obviously, but patent trend analysis is one of those alternative data sources that might give you an edge before quarterly reports catch up.

1o4geja,all,"China relocated 88,000 rural families into 'free' apartments. Now they can't afford groceries.","In China, like elsewhere villages were getting deserted as young were leaving for cities for work. To solve this Chinese govt, decided to take farmers out of crumbling 40 year old houses scattered across the countryside and move them into clean apartment complexes with proper sewage and parks. They reclaimed the land for large scale farming to build these complexes.

Now, the govt never considered that rural families used to grow their own vegetables right outside their door and had access to clean, organic, zero cost food. After relocation, they're buying everything from stores and the farming radius to their actual fields increased so much that many just stopped farming altogether and tried finding other work.

To make matters worse, the provincial government spent 3.5 billion yuan building these places but there's zero commitment for ongoing maintenance. And property management fees, which don't exist in traditional villages, are now expected and most farmers refuse to pay because the concept is alien to them and also their cost of living is increasing with income decreasing.

To top it all off, these apartments are still classified as rural homesteads under Chinese law. That means no property rights and no ability to sell. The farmers are stuck with an asset they can't liquidate in a place where they might not be able to make a living anymore.

Not all of these complexes failed, some actually are thriving but others have become ghost towns because everyone left for actual cities. The study found that only 8 out of 12 visited communities even completed their public service facilities, and only 4 were actually operational.

This massive urban planning exercise without on ground consultation has also led to farmers losing their safety net. When the next crisis hits (pandemic, recession, whatever), these families have no fallback and they are more vulnerable than before despite living in better conditions.

The researchers used SWOT model to analyze it and basically concluded that the policy could work BUT (and this is a big but) only if they solve the livelihood problem.

The full study is in Ecological Indicators, available [here ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X23015030)if you want the methodology and data tables. It's about Yancheng City but they interviewed 12 communities over 2021 and 2022.

1o0n7vw,all,"The hidden pitfall of monotherapy, and why ""dogma"" when it comes to transgender anything is foolish. Also why those with worse MTF results tend to have ADD/Anxiety/OCD/Autism and how to help fix it.","I am if nothing, consistently inconsistent.

I have been criticized about this for a long time. I will come up with a theory, talk about it online, see it work for some, not for others, and eventually cast it out (or discard the broken parts) until it ends up being refined enough that it can be ""published"".

Thing is, you can basically buy your way to publications, or even just create a website where it looks like you made a formal publication, but you peer reviewed yourself. This looks official, but doesn't make you right. (Also I have 3 pubs now, one of which launched a clinical trial for a new use for a drug, so anyone thumping that I don't publish can go pound sand) 

I personally love being proven wrong, as that means I learned something new, and I can further refine my theories. My theories are never ""correct"". Not ever. They just get more precise over time and could be described as ""less wrong than they used to be"".

As I continue to pull on the transgender onion, layer after layer comes off, and I am yet shocked to find another layer underneath, the perfect gift to an autistic puzzle solver like me. The infinite puzzle onion.

I've spent the past two years pouring over whole genomic sequences from hundreds of my patients, trying to see patterns come out of the snow of data to figure out what it is exactly that makes someone have gender dysphoria, and how that specific mutation screwed up their health otherwise. (And they often do)

From that experience, I have a fairly good idea of exactly how it happens, what causes it, and what is required to generate the phenotype all the way from the most subtle dysphoria to the crippling dysphoria of the child who comes out at 4 years old. That is my primary side project at the moment, and it will be published officially in due time once we're absolutely certain its airtight. That publication has to be so incredibly accurate as people on all political sides will lose their minds over it, and the slightest error will be used to try and shred the whole thing.

Regardless, as I wandered around in the dark, I've stumbled into a few discoveries that have been helping my patients transition better, and hilariously, they harken back to my very first discovery, now almost a decade ago.

Almost 10 years ago I shot my mouth off on the internet about seeing transgender women on oral estradiol have absolutely astronomical estrone:estradiol ratios, and how when I switched these women to injections, they suddenly saw renewed progress. I theorized this was due to competitive antagonism / partial agonism.

To explain that in simple terms, imagine a high school gymnasium with 20 chairs that say "" Estrogen receptor"". You take 20 kids and put red estradiol shirts on them, and start playing musical chairs. Aside from some really odd cirumstances, when the music stops, you're almost always going to see 20 red shirts in the chairs. However, what if we added in say 20 kids wearing a shirt that says ""estrone"". These kids are deaf and blind. They can feel around for a chair, but thats it. The estradiol kids would trounce them obviously. But what if we added 200 kids? 2000 kids? At a certain point, the gymnasium is utter bedlam and hardly anyone is in a chair. This is effectively how bicalutamide works. It crowds out the androgen receptor.

So I realized then, wow, this is what's happening here. But because I was no higher than I am now, a lowly, unaffiliated family physician from Detroit, nobody cared. I had no IRB, I had no university with which to publish this theory, so I put it online.

A decade later, I am sorting through hundreds of genomes (and some cis ones too) and I just keep running into mutations in 17B-HSD1. This makes me laugh, as I saw this a decade ago in lab testing, but had no idea why. Now I realize its literally related to the development of gender dysphoria in the first place.

This enzyme converts estrone to estradiol.

Imagine you have two cities that exist on two islands near each other. Between these cities is a bridge. People work and play and live on both sides, some working on one and living on another. As a result, the bridge is always busy. Imagine on any given day, you have 6 lanes going each direction. Well, imagine if suddenly 5 of the 6 lanes from Estroneville going to Estradiolopolis are closed, but 6/6 lanes from Estradiolopolis to Estroneville stay open. Rather quickly, you're going to notice the population piling up on the side of Estroneville. You can see that in this below diagram.

https://preview.redd.it/sxs68qs48qtf1.png?width=3574&format=png&auto=webp&s=591319b3c0456c26ccead814928da615790928a5

Now, this is where I really stopped looking at it a decade ago. I figured shifting the balance back towards estrone (by avoiding 17B-HSD2 by using parenteral estrogen) I could solve this problem.

Unfortunately, that just solves one tier of it.

There is a well documented phenomenon in ""queer"" people, be they of gender or sexual orientation. Certain psychiatric conditions show up in the community more often than in the genpop.

ADD (non-hyperactive type), Generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and Autism (anxious subtype), and when Schizophrenia is at play, the paranoid type.

Another odd thing I noticed over the years was that my skinny, anxious, flatter chested transgender women could pound down caffeine like it was nothing. I literally cannot consume a cup of coffee without being unable to sleep for 24 hours. The enzyme that metabolizes caffeine is 1A\*.

The enzyme which degrades estrone and estradiol into their ""phase 1 metabolites"" is 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1

Over a year of looking at hundreds of genomes, in the chart above, the mutations more or less sort like this.

Feminine humans (regardless of AGAB) tend to skew towards the left, towards 1A, and the weaker metabolites. They have damaged 1b1 enzymes but swift 1a enzymes. Masculine humans shift towards the right.

This is paradoxical, but the answer here is that estrogen masculinizes your brain before you are born. If you stereotypically think about lesbians, the most ""butch"" of lesbians will be rather estrogenic in appearance by comparison to femme ones. Aka Boo on Orange is the new black vs Shane on the L word.

This is why some hypermasculine dudebro with he-man gender dysphoria can go to the gym and shoot up testosterone and grow absolute honkers in the span of weeks, but I can take a castrated, feminine transgender woman and inject her with pure estradiol and she remains flatchested. How sensitive your estrogen signaling system is, and estrogenic exposure in utero determines a large portion of ""am I a boy or not"" and ""Should there be a penis here, am I a top?"".

Basically, if you are sensitive to estrogen and get hit with it pre-birth, it will masculinize your brain. But those same genes will cause feminization after you are born if you are hit with estrogen. (or fail to cause it if your estrogen sensitivity is poor)

This is literally why some of these stereotypes exist. There are 1000 ways to LGBTQ genetically, but overall, this one is fairly consistent. Not everyone, not all the time, as there are countless switch flips. But if you get basted with high estrogen signaling in utero, you're going to feel pretty masculine overall.

I'm not ready to drop my theory post on exactly how sexual orientation works, that needs some more polishing, but for now, what you need to know here is that nature likes to play jokes, and it is estrogen that makes you a man.

Estrogen also develops the penis fully, and estrogenic signaling anomalies are why so many mtf people have a urethral opening that doesn't end at a hole on the end of the penis but rather a vertical slit starting at the central penis tip, but then sliced downwards towards the bottom of the glans. This is the faintest level of detectable hypospadias. Go ahead, go look. Feel free to represent in the comments if this applies to you.

Anyway, back to why queer people and particularly MTFs have this psych connection.

Once estradiol or estrone are phase 1 metabolized into their secondary metabolite, either the 2-hydroxy or 4 hydroxy estrogens, they become something very very weak (2 hydroxy) or faintly weak (4 hydroxy). The 4 hydroxy is about half as potent as E2. The 2 hydroxies are in the 1/20th range (on average).

Now here's where it gets fun. Whats the connection between all these psych issues and trans people?

Well, the enzyme COMT has two jobs. Metabolizing neurotransmitters (like dopamine) and also degrading these estrogens into their phase 2 metabolites.

People who have slow COMT genes will have ADD (non-hyperactive type), Generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and Autism (anxious subtype), and when Schizophrenia is at play, the paranoid type more often then the general population. This is scientifically known and proven already.

But if you've got slow COMT, and you happen to shunt towards weak estrogen products, you build those products up.

Higher and higher and higher. These products act the same as estrone does against estradiol, effectively crowding it out.

Its basically my 2016 discovery all over again. But worse, as these can't be measured in the blood. These estrogens typically are measured in the urine, and that testing is expensive.

But in short, if you monotherapy yourself too high, what will end up happening is if you have slow COMT genes, you will literally overwhelm their capacity to detoxify these weak estrogen metabolites. They will build to higher and higher levels, until effectively blocking out your receptor.

I suspect this is the true reason for:

""I got better results at the beginning of transition""

""I stopped HRT for awhile and restarted and things worked for a few weeks then stalled out again""

You might be surprised to learn not all mammals menstruate. Those that do have increased COMT activity in reproductive tissue.

There may be a benefit to the ""period"". In cis females, this may be a time for 2-catechol washout.

I don't think this is truly necessary in MTF people, but being aware of your COMT genes, and that you might hit an upper limit of estrogen activity before you hit your SHBG maximum is a possibility.

I'm still toying around with this. I have a bunch of people who were ""stalled out"", we checked a urinary dutch test (2 hydroxies were high) and whom we did things to either lower their estrogen level and/or increase their COMT activity and saw improved progress. I only have a few follow up Dutch on those people demonstrating lab improvement concomitant with the improvement in transition efficacy.

Interestingly, COMT can be boosted by methylated B supplements (something we saw sometimes improved gender dysphoria almost 4 years ago now). This is probably the reason why that worked. COMT is also supported by certain types of magnesium, and SAMe directly, and other things indirectly like calcium D glucarate for example. 

I'm currently just messing around with the science of Phase 1 here, but Phase 2 is on the horizon of things I intend to explore. I just rarely see SULT/STS mutations in my patient genome review, but COMT mutations are insanely common. There may be benefit to Sulphoraphane to helping clear out things as well (and in phase 2).

I am undeterred by the current political climate. Me and my team (and rogue geniuses like Kate Meyer) are going to get to the bottom of why trans people exist and exactly why gender dysphoria happens. We will solve this, and in doing so, we hope to give people choices they never had before. Sometimes gender dysphoria can be fixed (I often give the case example of an FTM having it from 11-B-hydroxylase deficiency which resolved with treatment).

Sometimes it cannot be fixed (like when caused by a dead estrogen receptor gene).

But regardless of the pathway someone chooses (to treat their gender dysphoria or transition) simply understanding why the problem happened will open up new and improved treatments, which will improve patient health outcomes regardless of which path they choose. In my efforts to understand ""how it works"" I stumbled across this, which now I am using to improve MTF transition efficacy.

If you read to the very end of this very long post, thanks for supporting me these past 10 years. I'm not planning to bend the knee anytime soon. Y'all exist because god made you that way (or someone did with a drug or pregnancy uterine exposure). But what you and I choose to do about it together should be a decision made mutually at first, and ultimately by you. Not some court somewhere who has never met you or looked at your genome.

\- Dr Powers

PS: Maybe the next time I'm not totally burned out I'll do a whole post on the ""why queer people sit weirdly in chairs"" meme, but the answer is because most of you are hypermobile, and many of you with the MCAS/POTS/EDS/TIKTOK/IBS/PTSD constellation (cis or trans) have a 17-hydroxyprogesterone value of zero, and can't make cortisol on demand, so everything gets screwed up. Most of you can safely take 100mg of pregnenolone twice daily and some extra salt (ask your doctor first) and you'll likely feel better quickly. You're welcome.

PPS: I have high estrogen signaling autism (which I am now calling ""**Outism**"") which comes with high curiosity, hyperverbosity, and extremely low social fear until society punches us enough that we fall into line and decide ""society sucks because I keep trying to be nice and everyone calls me weird all the time"". Cis males that have this often ""seem"" gay as children, but are confused and angry at being called this from the time they are kids until they grow up enough to realize being called gay isn't an insult. Their high estrogen levels will make them empathetic and more sensitive than most cis men, and far less emotionally regulated. They are the ""lovable big teddy bear"" who likes magic the gathering and ren fest and rescues animals stereotype. They speak emphatically like Alistor on Hazbin Hotel (but without the evil). It is the opposite of the nonverbal, sensory stimuli sensitive kid. We love sensory input, information, and people (until we're trained to fear them). As a result, **I suck at being concise**. I literally cannot do it. So if someone wants to summarize this whole thing in the comments so it can ELI5 and help more people, I'll give it my rubber stamp if done well.",Drwillpowers,2025-10-08 00:07:21,285,0.97,234,519,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/DrWillPowers/comments/1o0n7vw/the_hidden_pitfall_of_monotherapy_and_why_dogma/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/1o0n7vw/the_hidden_pitfall_of_monotherapy_and_why_dogma/,self.DrWillPowers,0,Post by Dr. Powers,,0,none,"[""https://preview.redd.it/sxs68qs48qtf1.png?width=3574&format=png&auto=webp&s=591319b3c0456c26ccead814928da615790928a5""]",14367,198,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzhs1s,all,NiceGUI 3.0: Write web interfaces in Python. The nice way.,"We're happy to announce the **third major release of NiceGUI**.

[NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io) is a powerful yet simple-to-use UI framework to build applications, dashboards, and tools that run in the browser. You write Python; NiceGUI builds the frontend and handles the browser plumbing. It's great for modern web apps, internal tools, data science apps, robotics interfaces, and embedded/edge UIs — anywhere you want a polished web interface without frontend framework complexity.

We recently discussed NiceGUI on the Talk Python To Me podcast — [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74UXonJfl6o).

# Highlights

* **Single-Page Apps** with `ui.run(root=...)` \+ [`ui.sub_pages`](https://nicegui.io/documentation/sub_pages/)
* New **script mode** for small and tight Python scripts (see below).
* Lightweight [**Event system**](https://nicegui.io/documentation/event) to connect short‑lived UIs with long‑lived Python services.
* **Observables**: modify props/classes/style and the UI updates automatically.
* **Tables / AG Grid**: update live via `table.rows/columns` or `aggrid.options`.
* **Simplified pytest** [setup](https://nicegui.io/documentation/section_testing) and improved [`user` fixture](https://nicegui.io/documentation/user) for fast UI tests.
* **Tailwind 4** support.

Full notes & migration: [3.0.0 release](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

# Minimal examples

**Script mode**

    from nicegui import ui
    
    ui.label('Hello, !')
    ui.button('Click me', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('NiceGUI 3.0'))
    
    ui.run()

Run the file; your browser will show the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Single‑Page App (SPA)**

    from nicegui import ui
    
    ui.link.default_classes('no-underline')
    
    def root():
        with ui.header().classes('bg-gray-100'):
            ui.link('Home', '/')
            ui.link('About', '/about')
        ui.sub_pages({
            '/': main,
            '/about': about,
        })
    
    def main():
        ui.label('Main page')
    
    def about():
        ui.label('About page')
    
    ui.run(root)

When started, every visit to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) executes `root` and shows a header with links to the `main` and `about` pages.

# Why it matters

* **Build UI in the backend**: one codebase/language with direct access to domain state and services. Fewer moving parts and tighter security boundaries.
* **Async by default**: efficient I/O, WebSockets, and streaming keep UIs responsive under load.
* **FastAPI under the hood**: REST + UI in one codebase, fully typed, and proven middleware/auth.
* **Tailwind utilities + Quasar components**: consistent, responsive styling, and polished widgets without frontend setup.
* **General‑purpose apps**: explicit routing, Pythonic APIs, and intuitive server‑side state handling.

# Get started

* Install: `pip install nicegui`
* Documentation & Quickstart: [nicegui.io](https://nicegui.io) (built with NiceGUI itself)
* 3.0 release notes & migration: [3.0.0 release](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
* License: MIT. Python 3.9+.

Staying on top of the constantly growing skill requirements in Data Science is quite a challenge. To manage my own learning and growth, I've been curating a list of useful resources and tools.

While my main focus is data analysis, the reality is that skills in ML, DL, and data engineering are becoming essential for a well-rounded profile. I'm trying to improve my skills across all these areas.

I'd love to get your professional opinion. Could you please take a look? Have I missed anything crucial? What else would you recommend adding or focusing on?

To make it easier (so you don't have to click the link right away), I've attached screenshots of the table of contents below.

The full list with all links is available on GitHub, the link is at the end of the post.

EDIT: Removed universities from the list. A proper use case has been made for bringing in professors and specialty instructors.

Important Note: This map does not include data from the International Mobility Program (IMP), as the Government of Canada does not provide location-specific data for IMP streams, unlike LMIA.

1o2iyk1,all,Real global disasters that are barely being talked about,"I’ve been digging into a few ongoing environmental disasters that almost no one seems to be talking about, and honestly, it’s disturbing how bad some of them are.

**Syria’s toxic oil spill**
In Deir Az Zor, eastern Syria, an abandoned oil field (al-Taim) has been leaking produced water and crude oil since 2013. The spill has created a black, toxic river through the desert, over six miles long now, and it’s creeping toward the Euphrates River, which millions depend on for drinking and farming.

There’s no containment, no cleanup, and no government effort because of years of war and neglect. One flood could spread the contamination through Iraq and beyond.

https://www.circleofblue.org/newsletter/the-stream-september-16-2025-in-syria-uncontained-oil-spillage-flows-close-to-euphrates-river/


**Fukushima’s ongoing radioactive water release**
After the 2011 nuclear disaster, Japan’s TEPCO has been filtering and gradually releasing treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. Officially they say it’s safe, only tritium left, but many experts and NGOs argue otherwise.

There’s also a long history of the government downplaying or delaying radiation data, underestimating exposure, and reopening contaminated areas.

This has been going on for years, but most people stopped talking about it. Greenpeace and independent researchers still find measurable contamination in some regions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Diet_of_Japan_Fukushima_Nuclear_Accident_Independent_Investigation_Commission


**Indonesia’s caesium-137 contamination (2025)**
Just this month, Indonesia confirmed that 22 factories near Jakarta are contaminated with radioactive caesium-137 from improper waste disposal. Local workers have been unknowingly exposed for years.

**Ukraine toxic sediment release after Kakhovka dam collapse**
When the Kakhovka dam was destroyed, it didn’t just cause flooding, it also released decades of industrial sediment full of heavy metals. Researchers are now calling it an “ecological time bomb” spreading downstream through the Dnipro.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/13/kakhovka-dam-environment-heavy-metals-science-study/


**Slow-motion global drought crisis**
Across Africa, South America, and southern Europe, droughts are becoming more extreme every year. Crops are failing, lakes are disappearing, and water conflicts are escalating but it barely makes the news unless there’s a famine headline.

https://news.mongabay.com/2025/07/droughts-are-a-slow-moving-global-catastrophe-report-finds/

Meanwhile, the people with the power to actually change this, governments, billionaires, corporations, keep hoarding wealth instead of fixing what’s killing the planet.

Chaos and crisis are profitable for them, oil prices spike, land gets cheaper, and “reconstruction contracts” roll in. They win while the rest of us pay for it with our health, homes, and futures. 

Governments distract us with culture wars, elections, and fake outrage while quietly signing deals and cutting corners with the same industries causing the damage.

At some point, all this greed stops being a financial game and becomes a death sentence for everyone else.

Edit: I’ll try to find coordinates or satellite images for some of these sites soon (especially the Syrian spill) so people can look them up directly on Google Earth.

1o0echb,all,Bringing NumPy's type-completeness score to nearly 90%,"> Because NumPy is one of the most downloaded packages in the Python ecosystem, any incremental improvement can have a large impact on the data science ecosystem. In particular, improvements related to static typing can improve developer experience and help downstream libraries write safer code. We'll tell the story about how we (Quansight Labs, with support from Meta's Pyrefly team) helped bring its type-completeness score to nearly 90% from an initial 33%.

Multiple sources familiar with the matter told several news outlets including The New York Times and Washington Post that those who were notified of layoffs Friday included people on teams on infectious disease outbreaks, science and health data analysis and employee safety.

Hello all,

1o277oo,all,"Top of my PhD class, strong research background… not even one biotech interview. Why?","I’m finishing up my PhD in neuroscience, where I’ve spent the last few years developing data-driven, precision medicine, tools for analyzing biomedical brain imaging (fMRI) — heavy on Python, statistics, project management, and problem-solving.

I'm trying to break into industry and have applied to a wide range of biotech and life-science data roles (consultant, VC-fellow, data scientist, J&J precision medicine post doc). The only interview I've snagged so far was with a really fantastic VC firm, where I made it to the last round only to be rejected (VC/PE life-science consultant would be my top pick, if I had a choice, but alias, I do not!!).

For those of you who successfully made the leap from academia → biotech, can you please roast my resume for me and tell me what the f\*\*k I'm doing wrong. Seriously, you can tear me apart. No feelings will be hurt. 

I don't usually post on reddit, so this is just a last hail Mary and I appreciate all of your input.

1o1efvk,all,"Why ""The Patriarchy"" Is Actually a Gynocentric Oligarchy","**Bodily autonomy discrimination:**

* Draft: Only men must register for Selective Service (U.S.). No female draft, ever.
* MGM (Male Genital Mutilation): Legal, routine, and performed on male infants without consent. FGM is a felony, but MGM is ""cultural tradition.""
* Male victims of sexual assault are ignored or mocked while female perpetrators get slaps on the wrist (e.g., teacher-student sex cases).
* \#MeToo hypocrisy: Men are guilty until proven innocent. Women face no consequences for false accusations.

**Legal discrimination:**

* Women win 80%+ of custody battles, even in cases of abuse or neglect by the mother.
* Men are jailed for non-payment of child support, but women face no consequences for paternity fraud.
* Men receive **63%** longer prison sentences for the same crimes compared to women.
* False accusations (rape, DV) ruin men’s lives, but women face zero penalties for lying.
* The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funds primarily women's shelters, despite men making up 40-50% of domestic violence (DV) victims according to CDC and DOJ data. The CDC also reports that men are 3x less likely to report DV than women, suggesting that male victims are severely undercounted and systematically underserved, yet receive almost no institutional support.
* Duluth Model (used in DV cases) assumes men are always abusers - no evidence required.
* Men lose their homes, savings, and kids in no-fault divorce.
* Alimony is male-only slavery - women rarely pay it.

**Reproductive rights:**

* Women can abort a pregnancy at any time.
* Men have zero say, and even if they don’t want the child, they are still forced to pay child support.
* There is no financial abortion option for men - women can legally trap men with pregnancy.

**Economic discrimination:**

* Workplace Deaths: 93% of fatal occupational injuries are men (OSHA).
* Men are overwhelmingly employed in dangerous and deadly jobs such as mining, construction, oil rigs, factories, and the military. Women dominate safer, cushier jobs and benefit from diversity hiring.
* Men earn more on average because they work longer hours, take riskier jobs, and die younger. The wage gap is a statistical lie. When controlling for choices, the gap disappears or **reverses** in many fields.

**Media Narratives:**

* Men are always villains (abusers, deadbeats, rapists).
* Women are always victims, even when they’re the abusers (e.g., #BelieveWomen).
* News headlines highlight women and children victims while erasing male victims, even when male victims are the overwhelming majority.

**Education discrimination:**

* Boys are 2-3x more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls in female-dominated school systems, with \~1 in 5 boys medicated by age 12 for normal energetic behavior. These drugs carry risks like stunted growth and anxiety, with no proven long-term benefits.
* Boys face 3x more suspensions than girls, with black boys 6x more likely to be suspended than white girls. Subjective judgments by female teachers often penalize boys for ""defiance"" while overlooking girls' social aggression.
* Schools reward female-gendered strengths (sitting still, neatness), leaving boys 1.5 years behind in reading by high school. Boy-friendly teaching methods, like hands-on learning, are rarely used despite their effectiveness.
* Hundreds of girls-only STEM programs exist, but almost none for boys, despite boys scoring lower in science literacy. Girls also receive 12x more scholarships, while Title IX ignores boys' underperformance.
* Female teachers often grade boys more harshly for the same work, labeling their behavior as ""disruptive."" Curricula prioritize female protagonists and dismiss boys' interests like action and competition.
* Women now make up 59% of college students, with boys less likely to enroll or graduate. Colleges openly discriminate against boys in admissions, offering no equivalent to ""women's colleges"" or scholarships.
* 1 in 3 boys feel ""stupid or worthless"" in school, and boys aged 10-19 die by suicide at 3x the rate of girls. Schools prioritize girls’ mental health while subjecting boys to ""toxic masculinity"" lectures instead of support.
* Solutions like more male teachers, later start times, and boy-friendly teaching are rejected. Instead, schools implement punitive programs like ""Men's Behavior Change"" training, further alienating boys.

**Social Safety Nets:**

* 70% of homeless are men, but shelters and aid overwhelmingly serve women.
* Single mothers get housing, food stamps, and childcare while single fathers get nothing.
* Prostate cancer research receives half as much funding as breast cancer research despite affecting nearly identical numbers of men compared to breast cancer in women.
* Male mental health is routinely ignored (suicide rates 3-4x higher than women's).
* ""Women and children first"" policies prove female lives are inherently valuable while male lives are inherently disposable.

I’ve been hearing from a few people that new job offers are being delayed or withdrawn for students on STEM OPT. Some even said companies are avoiding STEM OPT candidates altogether due to recent changes or uncertainty.

1o0lu10,all,"Why Spectrum Matters for Connecting the World (New ASTS Editorial, Oct-25)","For AST SpaceMobile, spectrum is at the heart of our mission to bring true broadband from space to everyday smartphones. When you make a call, stream a video, or send a message, your phone is not just using hardware. It is tapping into an invisible resource called radio spectrum, the ‘lanes of a highway ’ in the sky, carrying the phone signals.  
  
This highway is a limited resource that is shared among users. Unlike a physical highway, spectrum is naturally occurring and cannot be created or manufactured. It must be licensed, shared, and managed, which is why securing the proper spectrum bands is essential for delivering services at scale.

Every data connection travels on this highway. The wider the road, which is often measured in bandwidth, the faster your data can move, and the more traffic it can handle. More spectrum means more lanes, supporting not just faster connections for individuals, but also the ability to serve millions of subscribers simultaneously without congestion.  
  
The type and amount of spectrum available determines how far your signal can reach, how fast your connection can be, how reliable your experience feels, and how many people can use the network at the same time.

# What Is Spectrum, and Why Does it Matter?

  
Spectrum is the fuel of wireless communications. Different bands of spectrum have unique characteristics:  


* **Low-band spectrum** (sub-1 Ghz): Good travel and propagation characteristics, including strong wall penetration; ideal for coverage in rural areas or indoors.
* **Mid-band spectrum** (1-6 Ghz): Balances speed and coverage, powering most of today’s 4G and 5G services.
* **Higher bands** (above 6 Ghz): Deliver lightning-fast speeds but over short distances.

  
Cell towers — and soon satellites — manage wireless traffic by assigning each connection a path across the spectrum and ensuring that calls, texts, and data reach their destination.

  
Without access to spectrum, even the most advanced satellite or cell tower is just hardware without capability. And without enough spectrum, networks may function, but they quickly become overloaded when too many subscribers try to connect at once.

# AST SpaceMobile’s Unique Spectrum Advantage

Unlike many satellite systems that can only handle basic texting, AST SpaceMobile is built for full broadband from inception. Our BlueBird satellites—the largest and most advanced commercial phased arrays ever deployed in low Earth orbit—are designed to tap into a broad range of premium spectrum bands globally.

  
As of today, AST SpaceMobile has access to:

1,150 MHz low- and mid-band tunable MNO spectrum globally

45 MHz of AST SpaceMobile-licensed MSS low-mid band spectrum in North America

60 MHz of AST SpaceMobile-licensed S-band spectrum outside North America

50+ MNO partners’ allocated spectrum





This is about what spectrum enables: the ability to power voice, video, apps, streaming , email, and browsing on your regular smartphone, without any special hardware or modifications.

# More Lanes, Faster Speeds, Greater Capacity

With over 1,150 MHz of tunable low-and mid-band MNO spectrum globally, our network functions like a private superhighway in the sky. Peak data rates of up to 120 Mbps mean everything you do on your phone works reliably, while the bandwidth ensures we can serve millions of users at once without bottlenecks.

# Exclusive Access

Licensed spectrum, including 45 Mhz of MSS low-mid band in North America and 60 Mhz of S-band spectrum elsewhere, provides dedicated lanes on this highway. These licenses ensure consistent, high quality service wherever you are.

# Seamless Integration

Through partnerships with more than 50 mobile network operators serving nearly 3 billion subscribers, our network connects directly with your existing carrier. Your phone will switch automatically to our satellites when you are outside terrestial coverage.

# AST SpaceMobile’s Unique Cost Efficiency Spectrum Advantage

The amount of spectrum we are securing also highlights a critical business advantage: cost efficiency.

The price paid for spectrum is a major factor in what the end user will ultimately pay for service. **By making smart and rational cost-efficient investments in spectrum, we are ensuring affordability for users and the long-term viability of our business.**

We are committed to offering a premium service while continuing to innovate for years to come, knowing our foundation is both technologically sound and financially sustainable.

# Why This Matters for Users

Spectrum is the difference between

A call dropping in the middle of nowhere vs. staying connected.

Weak signals at the edge of a network vs. 120 Mbps peak data speeds from space

Sending just a text vs. streaming video or joining a video call

A few people getting service vs. millions of subscribers connected at once

# Bringing It All Together

The future of mobile broadband isn’t about choosing between statellites or cell towers. It’s about bringing their strengths together.

Our unique spectrum strategy, combined with our groundbreaking satellite technology with the largest satellites ever deployed in low Earth orbit, spanning 2,400 square feet, is the reason we will be able to enable true cellular broadband from space. This is how we are building the future of connectivity and working to end the digital divide. 

With AST SpaceMobile’s spectrum-enabled approach, your phone simply works—anywhere on Earth.

That’s the power of spectrum. That’s the power of AST SpaceMobile.

1o50fn2,all,Asking as a foreigner: Why does the Aryan migration theory still spark so much controversy among Indians and specially the Indian government?,"I’ve been reading about the Aryan migration into ancient India, and I keep noticing that this topic generates very strong reactions. Some people insist it’s a “colonial myth” or even a “racist European invention,” while others paint it as a mostly peaceful migrant movement that blended with ancient Indians with almost no fight or oppression at all.  

From what I understand so far:

Genetics: Ancient DNA studies (Narasimhan et al., Science, 2019) show Steppe ancestry entering India after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization (around 2000–1500 BCE). This ancestry is more common in northern India and among upper castes, less so in the south.

Linguistics: Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European language family, sharing roots with Greek, Latin, and Old Persian — which seems difficult to explain without some historical population movement.

Archaeology: After the Indus Valley cities declined, we see changes in pottery, burial practices, and settlement patterns. Early Vedic texts even describe interactions (and sometimes conflicts) between ārya and dasa/dasyu peoples.

Social structure: The Rig Veda (10.90) lists the four varnas, which suggests some early form of hierarchy. It’s interesting how these ancient distinctions have been interpreted in modern times, sometimes turning into debates about “pure native origins” and national pride.

It seems that, despite multiple lines of scientific evidence pointing toward migration and cultural blending, discussions about this topic often become extremely defensive. Some of the strongest reactions appear to come from those who want to emphasize India as an entirely self-contained, uninterrupted civilization — which is understandable from a pride perspective, but perhaps not fully aligned with the data.

So my question is: 

Why does the Aryan migration topic continue to be so politically and emotionally charged, and apparently heavily censored due to lack of Indian sources about the matter, even in academic discussions. 

I’m genuinely curious to understand the sociological, historical, or cultural reasons behind this defensiveness, that in my point of view is really unnecessary, most countries endured harsh subjugation from foreign populations, most of Southern and Eastern Europe was under Muslim occupation for centuries, and suffered under that influence just like India did. 

Anyway, I’m not here to argue, just to learn why that specific part of history is so important to Indians to the point of discussing it being almost taboo.

1o27673,all,Applied to 50+ biotech roles. Not one interview. What’s going wrong?,"I’m finishing up my PhD in neuroscience, where I’ve spent the last few years developing data-driven, precision medicine, tools for analyzing biomedical brain imaging (fMRI) — heavy on Python, statistics, project management, and problem-solving.

I'm trying to break into industry and have applied to a wide range of biotech and life-science data roles (consultant, VC-fellow, data scientist, J&J precision medicine post doc). The only interview I've snagged so far was with a really fantastic VC firm, where I made it to the last round only to be rejected (VC/PE life-science consultant would be my top pick, if I had a choice, but alias, I do not!!).

For those of you who successfully made the leap from academia → biotech, can you please roast my resume for me and tell me what the f\*\*k I'm doing wrong. Seriously, you can tear me apart. No feelings will be hurt. 

I don't usually post on reddit, so this is just a last hail Mary and I appreciate all of your input.

1o29puf,all,🚀🚀 $CCCX – The SPAC That Gets You NVIDIA’s QUANTUM PARTNER on the Cheap 🚀🚀,"Alright, you degens, listen up. I’ve been digging through the garbage pile of SPACs and found a goddamn diamond. Forget your money-burning penny stonks and quantum meme stocks with no revenue. I’m talking about Churchill Capital Corp X ($CCCX), and it’s our ticket to the quantum tendie-verse.

**The DD (strap in, this is the good part):**

So, what is this thing? $CCCX is a SPAC that’s merging with a company called Infleqtion. Who the hell is Infleqtion? Only the most legit neutral atom quantum computing company on the block. And here’s the kicker: they are a direct partner with our lord and savior, NVIDIA ($NVDA).

The Deal: CCCX is taking Infleqtion public at a $1.8 billion valuation. They are on track to be listed under the ticker ""INFQ"".

This isn't some pre-revenue garbage fire. While other ""quantum"" stocks are trading at insane fantasy valuations, Infleqtion is the real deal.

* $IONQ: 133x Price/Sales
* $RGTI: 897x Price/Sales
* $QUBT: 10,250x Price/Sales (not a typo, check for yourself)

Meanwhile, $CCCX/Infleqtion is coming in at a sane 34.5x P/S. You're getting a 1,000%+ discount to its moron peers.

**The NVIDIA Connection & Real Business**

This is the alpha. Infleqtion isn't just using Nvidia's stuff; they are a highlighted strategic partner. Nvidia has showcased them at GTC events and in their own developer blogs for their CUDA-Q platform. When Jensen Huang's company is giving you the nod, you pay attention. They even ran the first-ever logical qubit experiment using Nvidia's platform. This is DEEP integration.

Unlike 99% of the SPAC trash, Infleqtion has **ACTUAL REVENUE**:

* $29 million in real, hard cash revenue (not promises).
* 3 quantum computers SOLD and delivered.
* Hundreds of sensors already deployed in the field.
* $300 million customer pipeline.
* Clients? Oh, just some small names like the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, the U.K. Government, and... NVIDIA ITSELF.

Even the notorious short-sellers at Citron Research are bullish on this one. They literally said, ""Infleqtion has customers, revenue, and NVIDIA validation."" They see the massive opportunity the rest of the market is sleeping on.

**The Government Catalyst (Here's the real juice)**

Now, get this. The White House is about to pour jet fuel on this fire. They're drafting executive orders to fast-track quantum tech adoption across the ENTIRE U.S. government, focused on national security and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). They're not just funding university research, they're mandating that federal agencies upgrade their systems ASAP to defend against quantum attacks. [thequantuminsider+2](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/09/20/reports-white-house-prepares-executive-actions-on-quantum-tech-and-post-quantum-cybersecurity/)

Who benefits? Not the pre-revenue demo quantum shit-stonk companies. The government needs proven, deployable tech, not science projects. They need companies that can deliver yesterday. [spinquanta](https://www.spinquanta.com/news-detail/quantum-computer-companies-to-invest-in-why-spinq-technology-leads-the-future-of-quantum-computing)

That’s Infleqtion. They are already selling to the DoD and NASA. They have the hardware and the security focus the government is demanding. While $IONQ and $RGTI are busy trying to convince investors they have a product while insiders dump like crazy, Infleqtion is already embedded with the exact agencies that will be getting billions in mandates to buy this tech. The EOs are a direct pipeline of government cash to companies that can execute, and Infleqtion is at the front of the line. [cyberscoop+1](https://cyberscoop.com/trump-administration-quantum-computing-executive-action/)

**Why This Is Going to Print**

Look, every regard on this sub is chasing AI. But what’s next? Quantum-powered AI. Barron's is already calling the current quantum market a ""bubble,"" with stocks like $QUBT dropping 10% on dilutive offerings and $RGTI missing targets after a 5,000% run-up.

Smart money is about to rotate from the overpriced, no-revenue garbage into the ONE name with a proven business model and a firehose of government money pointed right at it.

You're not buying a story here. You're buying into a real company with real tech, real revenue, and partnerships with both the most important tech company on the planet and the most powerful government. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor before the institutional FOMO kicks in and this thing goes parabolic.

**TL;DR:** $CCCX is merging with Nvidia's quantum partner, Infleqtion. They have real revenue, top-tier clients (DoD, NASA), and a stamp of approval from Nvidia. Impending government executive orders will funnel cash directly to them, not their speculative peers. Get in before the rockets leave without you.

🚀🚀🚀 TO VALHALLA! 🚀🚀🚀

**🚀 $CCCX MOONSHOT DD: CIA’s Quantum Ace + NVIDIA’s Secret Sauce 🚀**  
(Friday, October 10, 2025)

Good morning degens,

As I alluded to yesterday, this is the DD that’ll rewrite your portfolio - and The Street still hasn’t caught on. $CCCX isn’t just another SPAC - it’s the quantum unicorn handpicked by the CIA’s own venture arm (In-Q-Tel) and turbocharged by NVIDIA. Here’s why this is basically a 10-bagger in the making:

1. **CIA’S Midas Touch (Background of In-Q-Tel):** In-Q-Tel is the nonprofit VC arm of the U.S. CIA, founded to scout and fund breakthrough tech for national security. They’ve backed 800+ companies over 25 years, creating market legends like: – Palantir (PLTR): $2M seed → $430B market cap = 200,000x return – Keyhole → Google Earth: CIA-funded startup acquired by Google → multibillion-dollar product – Anduril: Early-stage backing → $30.5B valuation in 2025 – Databricks: Strategic partner → $43B unicorn

In-Q-Tel’s quantum winners average 1000x+ returns. This is literally how fortunes are made.

1. **WHY THEY BACKED INFLEQTION – Quantum = National Security:** Biden’s whole-of-government memo & CIA nominee call quantum “pivotal to our future.” Governments pay top dollar for stealth detection & code-breaking tech. Trump will further back this race with quantum-related executive orders. Infleqtion’s quantum sensors are already fielded by DoD, NASA, and UK gov - real revenue, not vaporware. CIA investment ensures U.S. and her allies stay top dog in the quantum arms race.
2. **NVIDIA SUPERCHARGE – First Logical Qubit Demo:** Infleqtion + NVIDIA CUDA-Q nailed the first-ever materials-science experiment on logical qubits. Joint demos with top universities proved massive performance gains. NVIDIA showcases Infleqtion at GTC events and in dev blogs - only their top-tier partners get that flex. (Easter egg: NVIDIA’s Group Product Manager for Quantum Computing is leading a talk on “Accelerating Quantum Computing Breakthroughs” on Oct 28.) NVIDIA isn’t just demo-ing - they’re buying Infleqtion’s quantum sensors.  [https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/sessions/quantum-computing-and-hpc/](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/sessions/quantum-computing-and-hpc/)
3. **THE PERFECT STORM – Dual Validation:** CIA says “this tech is mission-critical,” NVIDIA says “we’ll power it.” Unlike IONQ/RGTI burning cash, Infleqtion has real gov revenue, a $200M+ pipeline, and a $540M+ war chest from the SPAC. The CEO plans to deploy this cash for strategic quantum acquisitions and talent expansion. $INFQ shares can swallow private quantum rivals who can’t get CIA or NVIDIA backing.
4. **WHY YOU DON’T NEED TO USE YOUR AMYGDALA, FOCUS ON PATTERN RECOGNITION:** In-Q-Tel quantum winners gave birth to Palantir, Anduril, Google Earth, Databricks - all 1000x+ cases. This Isn’t speculation or emotional, it’s pattern recognition. CIA doesn’t back losers. NVIDIA doesn’t partner with losers. Infleqtion is the quantum unicorn they both trust.

Degens, strap in and hold tight, because this quantum rocket is fueled by the CIA’s playbook and NVIDIA’s firepower, and there’s no turning back once ignition hits. 🌕🚀💎

1o3v6gj,all,Favorite Completed Series (3+ Books): Nomination,"***Nominations are being tallied, so new nominations and changes in upvotes cannot be guaranteed to be included*** 



We’ve seen an uptick in recommendation requests asking for people’s favorites, but this idea has honestly been floating around in my head for a while—ever since seeing the data on what the titles were called the most by the bot over 2024. I was curious of it actually represented what we love the most, or just what fits the most requests (or if there are just a small number of people like me who recommend a lot, so books we tend to like can have a disproportionate showing whenever they fit the requests). 

All-time favorite was a little daunting, though, so I broke it down into two parts. [Favorite Standalone/Completed Duet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/s/Gg7US2D5s6) wrapped up a few weeks ago, and now it’s time for favorite completed series! (Incomplete series may have their moment as well, if I do favorites by subgenre.)

**THE PLAN**  

This post is for people to nominate titles they think should be considered, and it will be open for two days. Similar to previous times, the titles with the highest number of upvotes will go to the qualifiers, while there will also be a round for runoffs, to make sure even things that got added later get a fair chance at visibility; runoffs will be open for two days as well. Up to 36 options will make it to the qualifiers, and the winner of each qualifier will go to the finals. 

**WHAT QUALIFIES**

Anything suggested here needs to fit certain parameters. If something doesn’t quite fit, you can make a case for it, and I’ll make a decision\*.

1. The series must have at least three full-length novels in it.
2. The series must be complete and all books in it must have been published.
3. Books in the series cannot have qualified to be included in Best Standalone/Completed Duet.
4. Each book in the seriee should  have the same protagonists, or return to the same protagonists for at least one additional novel after their introduction (Cute but Psycho is the example I’m thinking of that would count, though I don’t remember if the final novel has been published). All genres are welcome!   
5. Any genre is welcome.
6. ETA—completed series about a single relationship group in a larger connected universe are okay, even if the larger universe is not finished.

\* If your case is that Losers should be included, the decision is “No.”

**GUIDELINES FOR THIS ROUND**

1. Please check if whatever you want to add has already been included. I have methods of dealing with multiple submissions, and I know it’s going to happen, but if possible I’d like to limit it. If something is nominated multiple times, the highest number of upvotes for a single comment will be what determines its ranking.
2. You can add things that you know are popular, even if they’re not your favorite (I will have done that even with books I haven’t read because I see them get mentioned so often). 
3. Please include both the series title and the author. Name of the first book can also be included.
4. Please only add one option per comment (so if you have multiple suggestions, you’ll need to make multiple comments). That allows me to determine if the upvotes are actually meant for that specific book, versus only one of a group being liked and people not caring as much about the others. 
5. Only books in the top-level comments will be considered. 
6. Please upvote books that you like, and feel free to add comments about why you like it. It doesn’t have to be your all-time favorite for you to upvote it. Literally, as long as you enjoyed it. You can upvote as many things as you would like in these first rounds.
7. At the same time, ***please don’t downvote books you don’t like***. First, it skews with the science, particularly if only a couple people are doing it. Second, as long as no one is being rude, it feels uncalled for; these are opinions, and no one’s opinion is bad or wrong. Third, it won’t actually make a difference—while I don’t have visibility into the comments other people made, for any that don’t make the qualifiers automatically and go to the runoff, I’ll be the one putting them in, so I will be able to calculate the actual number of upvotes based off of vote total and upvote percentage, and that’s the number I use for ranking (I am *serious* about the validity of my Science). 
8. Likewise, I can’t stop it, but I would ask that everyone *please* not make negative remarks about other people’s suggestions. There are almost no universally loved books; not all books are right for all readers, and that’s okay. But I’d prefer this to be a post where people get to talk about what makes them happy, without worry about shame or judgment.   (Y’all can complain about the chosen books that are popular enough to make it to the qualifiers.)
9. If people suggest something and delete their comment and it’s not something that’s already in a different comment, I’m only moving on with it if the bot comment is upvoted (since that shows interest from someone).
10. The nominations will be open for two days.

With all that said, let me know if there are any questions.

1o3rwju,all,How Science Led Me Away From Atheism After Eight Years: The Short Version.,"Ironically, I stopped being an atheist because I got too invested in science. The more I studied the fine tuning of the universe, the harder it became to believe that everything just happened. The physical constants that allow life, such as gravity, the cosmological constant, and the strength of the electromagnetic force, are tuned within unimaginably precise margins. If any of them were off by even a tiny fraction, stars couldn’t form, chemistry wouldn’t exist, and consciousness would never arise. The mathematical odds are so infinitesimal that calling it chance starts to sound less scientific and more like faith in randomness itself.

At some point, I realized that the probability argument collapses under its own weight. Either we accept that we somehow won the most impossible cosmic lottery, or there is an underlying intelligence, principle, or structure that allows for existence.

Then there is consciousness, the great anomaly. It is not something we can quantify, yet it is the only thing we directly experience. The fact that there is an observer, that awareness exists at all, might be the biggest clue about reality’s nature. I have come to believe that consciousness, or some form of continued existence, is not just a hopeful idea but a fundamental aspect of the universe, perhaps even more primary than matter itself.

And even looking historically, it surprised me to learn that most scholars and historians, including secular ones, agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure, as verifiable as someone like Christopher Columbus. What they debate is not whether he existed, but what he was, and whether his teachings and claims hold any metaphysical truth.

So I did not turn away from atheism because I abandoned reason. I moved beyond it because reason itself pointed somewhere deeper. I did not find faith by rejecting science. I found it by following the data, the math, and the mystery to their most honest conclusions.",Christopher_Molina,2025-10-11 15:41:34,115,0.79,317,432,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Christianity/comments/1o3rwju/how_science_led_me_away_from_atheism_after_eight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1o3rwju/how_science_led_me_away_from_atheism_after_eight/,self.Christianity,0,Crossposted,,0,none,[],1964,74,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o39b1k,all,Aren’t we confusing symptoms with consequences?,"We tend to think of Covid as an infection you recover from – but research is beginning to show a darker picture (scientific references below).

SARS-CoV-2 does more than cause acute illness: it disrupts immune surveillance, weakening the body’s ability to catch abnormal cells – that alone should make anyone stop and think! It creates chronic inflammation, a known driver of cancer development. And it can reactivate latent viruses like Epstein-Barr or HPV, viruses already linked to cancers.

And there’s more: autopsy and persistence studies reveal that the virus lingers in tissues for months, sometimes years. Ongoing immune activation, oxidative stress, and tissue damage set the stage for malignant transformation. Several studies and reviews raise concern that SARS-CoV-2-driven immune dysregulation and viral persistence could increase long-term oncogenic risk, but definitive population-level incidence data are still emerging.

This doesn’t mean everyone who gets Covid will develop cancer. But it does mean that dismissing repeated infections as “just a cold” is dangerously naïve. Each infection may push the body closer to long-term consequences we cannot yet fully measure.

What really gets on my nerves is that most discussions about Covid stop at the surface: whether symptoms are mild, moderate, or severe. But the severity of an infection cannot be measured only by how sick it makes you feel in the short term. What truly matters is what it leaves behind. A virus that seems “mild” today can still inflict silent, cumulative damage – eroding resilience, inflaming tissues, and sowing the seeds of chronic disease years later.

And that is, in the end, the true problem with this virus: it makes you think it’s just a cold because you don’t *feel* what damage is silently, slowly and cumulatively being caused to your organs…

That’s why, even after all this time, I refuse to drop my guard: I still monitor CO₂ indoors, wear an N95 mask in enclosed spaces, and keep my immune system supported with proven measures, such as vaccination, ventilation, masking, and nutritional support (vitamin D3–K2–A, curcumin, silymarin, EGCG…).

How long will we keep calling it “mild” before we face what it truly does beneath the surface?

1o57moh,all,Is anyone else struggling to get hired lately?,"I’m starting to wonder if it’s just me or if jobs really aren’t hiring like they used to.

I have years of experience in different fields including military police, security, shipping coordination, and event management for tabletop games. I went back to school, finished my degree, and recently graduated with a master’s in library science. I’ve been trying to build a new career path, but it feels impossible to even get a foot in the door.

I’ve been applying nonstop for months for jobs like library assistant, digital archives, data entry, customer service, and anything I’m even remotely qualified for. I’m barely getting interviews, and when I do, they stop responding afterward.  

The part that really gets me is that when I include my education and experience, I get told I’m overqualified. When I leave it off, I’m underqualified. It’s like there’s no winning and student loans are ready to be paid in a few months.  Bills are piling up and I feel like a burden.

I’m not being picky either. I’ve applied for full-time, part-time, in-person, remote, anything. I haven’t landed a single job.

It didn’t used to be like this. I’ve always been able to find work, even when it wasn’t great. Now it feels like no one is actually hiring, or the ones that are want years of experience for $12 an hour.

1o0w50m,all,How I finally stopped watering down content for my ELL students,"Stop giving ELL kids ""easier"" versions. They need scaffolded access to the SAME rigorous content, not kindergarten-level substitutes.

I used to simplify everything for my 60% ELL classroom. Turns out that was actually holding them back.

The fix: Multiple entry points to identical content instead of different content entirely.

Revolutionary War example - instead of simplified timelines, I created:

-Visual timelines with vocab pre-taught in Spanish/Vietnamese

-Primary sources with sentence frames

-Collaborative activities where language differences = strengths

Results: ELL students went from 40% to 78% on grade-level assessments. More importantly, they stopped asking for ""easy versions"" and started demanding challenging work.

I do all this with TeachShare (because of Leslie Fisher’s webinar). It cites actual learning science research about why ELL students need complex text with proper support. Combo that with QuestionWell for properly designed visuals and you’ll have killer  lessons planned out with great visuals, while saving time altogether.

Btw, I still use ChatGPT.. but not for the basic use cases everyone use it for. I use the lesson plans pdfs I generate with TeachShare to create custom GPTs inside ChatGPT. With all the differentiated lesson plans for the semester, test grades, proper labeling and accurate dates I basically own a virtual assistant that I can ask questions regarding how the semester is developing and generate performance and efficiency reports. PS: of course when it comes to personal info, nothing goes into ChatGPT, only grade averages so I can track and generate insightful reports with historical data).

Not perfect, still review everything, but first AI tool that understands accessible ≠ easier, and saves 3-4h during weekends.

1o1745i,all,Singapore just made itself the copyright safe harbor for AI development,"Found something interesting in a study I am reading about AI and copyrights. AI companies are fighting copyright cases in US, EU, India and rest of the world,  meanwhile, Singapore looked at the situation and said we're going to make this explicitly legal and attract all the AI companies.

They amended their Copyright Act to include a computational analysis defense specifically for machine learning. It's basically a safe harbor that says if you're doing computational data analysis to improve AI systems, you're protected from copyright infringement claims. The law even prevents contractual override, which I think is bit too much, but as things stand copyright holders can't just put no AI training in their terms of service and block it.

This is the opposite of what's happening everywhere else. The EU AI Act requires transparency about training datasets and watermarking synthetic content. The US is letting it play out through lawsuits. China has its own complex regulatory framework.

Singapore looked at this mess and decided to make their jurisdiction the most attractive place to develop AI models. Going against the traditional consensus or trying to protect copyright holders, they are making a strategic bet that being AI friendly will bring investment and innovation to their economy.

This is not the first time they have pulled off something like this. It's basically the same play that made Singapore a financial hub. Create clear, favorable regulations while everyone else is stuck in analysis paralysis.

For anyone who is working on building the next foundation model and being worried about getting sued into oblivion for using the training data, Singapore just became very attractive proposition.

The catch is that this only protects you in Singapore. If you train your model there but deploy it globally, you're still exposed to lawsuits in other jurisdictions. But at least the core development work is protected.

Many will have the money to use, as Palmers return from injury is still uncertain and his data was horrific in his starts this season, 0.34xGI/90. I’m confident Chelsea can be covered with Enzo who’s getting into fantastic positions and playing far higher up, is on a lot of set pieces as well.

I imagine many of the content creators will be looking to get Isak in GW13 and may opt for Joao Pedro instead, who will be template but hasn’t played well in the past few games. 

Isak is 10% owned but that’s mostly by dead teams or not engaged managers, so he does qualify as somewhat of a differential.

But with the actual work it feels like a pressuried job that you're responsible for the underlying platform all the time. Constant context switching and never ending tasks with broader scope is sometimes overwhelming. I really feel that development is a lesser stessful role compared to this.

I'm with a strong mathematical and engineering background. With that background I feel that data science / data engineering can be a much better role for me compared to DevOps.

1o39ec1,all,People should stop using pre-prints to make headlines... It's hurting science.,"I've noticed that in some fields, including mine (social psychology), researchers have increasingly started using preprints as a way to make headlines with their work.

Personally, I find this ethically problematic for several reasons, and I think it’s something the academic community should openly discuss.

I dislike the growing tendency among some researchers to act as if peer review is optional — as if they’re confident enough in their work that external evaluation is unnecessary. I think this attitude undermines one of the core principles of scientific integrity.

Using preprints primarily for visibility feels a bit like gaming the system. I understand that the peer review process is often long and frustrating, but instead of bypassing it, our collective effort should go toward improving it. Peer review may be imperfect, but it exists for a reason: it provides the checks and balances that help us produce rigorous, credible, and trustworthy science.

In the long run, skipping this process just to get a headline or quick media attention actually hurts the credibility of the discipline. It risks reducing public trust in researchers—especially when the findings from these preprints are overinflated or overstated. When preparing a paper, everyone tends to think their findings are meaningful, but without careful review, it’s easy to stretch interpretations beyond what the data truly support.

I do understand the utility of preprints in exceptional circumstances, such as during COVID, when rapid dissemination of knowledge was crucial. They can also be valuable tools to spark discussions within the scientific community, especially for papers with novel or controversial ideas that might otherwise struggle to find their place in traditional journals.

However, I firmly believe preprints should not be used as a tool to popularize science among the general public. Most people—and even many journalists—don’t fully understand the difference between a peer-reviewed article and a preprint reviewed only by the authors themselves. Blurring that line can easily mislead audiences and ultimately damage the credibility of science as a whole.

1nz5zzz,all,T22: Odds are against it making landfall.,"What a difference 18 hours can make, right? In what's become a fascinating case study in both the frustrations and excitement of atmospheric science, the forecast track for Typhoon 22 (""Halong"") has shifted dramatically.

Just yesterday, through most of Sunday morning, nearly every model, except for WeatherNews, suggested a high probability that T22 would make a run toward the Japanese main islands. I'll admit, I was excited. I have a definite bias for wanting a direct typhoon hit, not just because I love wild weather, but also because much of Japan is currently facing a critical water deficit. A direct hit from a healthy typhoon would go a long way toward balancing our water budget. While there have been some exceptions (Kyushu/Hokkaido), it’s largely been a dry year for most of Japan.

But biases don't drive the weather. physics does. And the last 18 hours have shown just how quickly things can change. In fact, no sooner had I posted my T22 update yesterday afternoon than the 06Z model runs were published, and with them, the track changes started to appear across the board.

*""Z what, Neko Dash?  What are you talking about?"" I hear some of you say.  I'll get into the ""Z"" thing a little later. For now, let's stick with the typhoon track.*

The latest modeling shows a significant eastward shift in T22's projected movement. Where the previous models were scattered but broadly suggested a hit on Kyushu, there is now a broad consensus that the typhoon will complete its northward and eastward arc well out in the Pacific, far from Japan's home islands. As things look now, we might get some stray bands of rain and a few gusts of wind along the Pacific coast, but not much else. If the current models hold—and honestly, there's no guarantee of that since we're still days away—T22 will have minimal, if any, interaction with the main islands. The Ogasawara Islands, however, will likely bear the full brunt of the storm and appear to be the sole recipients of any direct effects from T22.

I'm going to wait another 24 hours before making a final call, just to see if any other steering mechanisms decide to interact with T22. But, as it stands, it looks like this typhoon will also give Japan a pass.

  Really quick: Typhoons are largely steered by high pressure areas.  For all their strength and power, typhoons are delicate storms in the face of a competing high.  I guess it would be a good idea to put together a quick post dedicated to how low pressure and high pressure systems interact, but, for now, let’s leave it with this: A typhoon will be pushed around by a similarly strong high pressure system.  

**T22's Steering Mechanism**

  So what is driving T22?  There are two major factors steering the storm at the moment:

1. **The Subtropical Ridge:** The most significant factor steering Typhoon Halong is a large and powerful high-pressure system, known as the subtropical ridge, that currently  extends across the Pacific. Typhoons, like other tropical cyclones, tend to move along the periphery of these high-pressure systems. In the case of Typhoon Halong, a high-pressure system is positioned to the north of the storm's current location. The clockwise circulation around this high-pressure system is effectively pushing the typhoon to the west or west-northwest.  In practical terms, this can be visualized as a wall of high pressure over Japan.
2. **The Mid-Latitude Trough and Recurvature:** The reason for the expected turn to the north and then east (a process known as ""recurvature"") is a change in the steering pattern. As the typhoon moves westward, it will eventually encounter a developing trough of low pressure in the mid-latitudes (over or near Japan). This trough is a low-pressure system associated with the jet stream. The counter-clockwise circulation around this trough will begin to pull the typhoon northward and then eastward.  Again, in practical terms, once the storm gets to a certain north latitude, it will start to be picked up by the winds of the Jet Stream, which will rapidly push the storm to the northeast.

  *Oh, one last thing:*  
  I mentioned “Z” a little while up there.  It’s not a nod to a comic book character or anything.  “Z” is shorthand for UTC, or Universal Coordinated Time, which some of us old folks may know as GMT (Greenwich Meridian Time).   Based on the 0 Longitude line, which runs through London, England, every time zone increment west or east will be either plus or minus Z (+Z / -Z).  Because of the number of time zones and their inconsistencies (think US Daylight Savings Time, and the fact that some areas don’t observe it, for instance), using UTC, or “Z” as a baseline makes things really handy.  Japan is 9 hours ahead of GMT/UTC, so we often say Japan is “+9Z"" for Japan Standard Time (JST).  When I referred to the 06Z data, that means the data that was compiled and generated at 6am, Z/UTC time.  Add nine hours to that for Japan, and you get 15:00.  So, no sooner did I post yesterday’s typhoon article than I saw the 15:00 (Japan time) data and realized things were moving east.

  The UTC to JST quick conversion table is:

 00Z = 09:00, JST

 03Z = 12:00 (noon), JST

 06Z = 15:00, JST

 09Z = 18:00, JST

 12Z = 21:00, JST

 15Z = 00:00, JST (midnight)

 18Z = 03:00, JST (add one day)

 21Z = 06:00, JST (add one day)",Neko_Dash,2025-10-06 06:56:53,95,1.0,26,121,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/japanweather/comments/1nz5zzz/t22_odds_are_against_it_making_landfall/,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanweather/comments/1nz5zzz/t22_odds_are_against_it_making_landfall/,self.japanweather,0,Typhoon,,0,none,"[""https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)"", ""https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html"", ""https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html"", ""https://preview.redd.it/f1ih3og58etf1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeb2a6912b2959167983f62a7d7a8e24f3ebae47)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/gz9l0qg58etf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4917fa95e2cba12b4a7f3128965d3b3cbd7e101)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/04e7upg58etf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c720e74fd5ec188ddefd2a20c392835084d1e9bb)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/lctzdpg58etf1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=577a1dfe345e4690403ce5422920cc41d03835b2)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/8q7lyog58etf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5d84207c8673f3e39889aa06e1970dbdbe5839e)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/agif0pg58etf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac3e412c5bef5e4f34f749531c13e636752e03a2)""]",6970,41,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o21g35,all,ChemStats Archiv: Eine kleine Reise in gehebelte Welten - Vectis Mundi (Teil II),"Liebe Mitreisende auf der Mauerstrasse, liebe Wegelagerer in den Finanzgassen,

nachdem der Selige Amumbo nun auf den Märkten wandelt, freue ich mich, euch zu einem weiteren Abstecher in die gehebelten Welten zu begrüßen! Wie bereits im letzten Beitrag angedeutet, hat mich die Frage bewegt, wie sich eine Investition in gehebelte Weltregionen geschlagen und wie sich ihre Trends und Dynamiken auf den Seligen Amumbo (ISIN: FR0014010HV4, WKN: ETF888) ausgewirkt hätten. Zumindest war das mein Plan für eine ruhige Reihe...

Allerdings war mir nicht klar, dass ich einen Wettlauf gegen die Zeit führen würde, denn leider hat die MSCI Inc. seit Kurzem einen Großteil ihrer Daten in Subscription-Archiven versteckt, weshalb wir uns ein weiteres Mal fragiler Künste bedienen werden, um Renditen aus einem Hauch von Nichts zu erschaffen... Also, legen wir los!

**ZL;NG**

* Projektziel: Simulation des Seligen Amumbos und gehebelter Weltportfolios auf Basis von MSCI-Regionen-Indizes von 01-01-1975 bis 31-08-2025.
* Indizes & Modelle: Rekonstruktion täglicher Preisindizes aus Monatsdaten via Constraint Quadratic Approach und Simulation gehebelter Regionen-Produkte.
* Pro Regionen: Deutliche Renditepotenziale in kurzen Zeiträumen (z.B. Pazifik +3 pp p.a., Emerging +2 pp p.a.) durch Momentum-Effekte und Bubble-Phasen; Moving-Average-Strategien senkten Drawdowns um 30 bis 40 pp und steigerten Renditen um bis zu 2 pp.
* Contra Regionen: Hohe Volatilität und starke Streuungen (IQR bis 24 pp); Drawdowns bis 95% (Pazifik und Emerging); langfristig keine stabile Überlegenheit im Vergleich zum Diversifikationseffekt des Seligen Amumbos – zumindest in der Einzelkritik.
* Ausblick: Regionale Hebel haben für den Großteil keine Vorteile; sie sind jedoch ideal für Momentum-Strategien, um regionale Exzesse abzuschöpfen.

**Beiträge der Reihe:** [**Teil I**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/1n6je6h/chemstats_archiv_eine_kleine_reise_in_gehebelte/) **– Teil II**

**Einleitung**

In diesem Beitrag zeige ich euch, 1.) welche Modelle und Ansätze ich zur Schätzung täglicher Preisindexwerte aus Monatsdaten für die vier Hauptregionen des MSCI-Universums eingesetzt habe, 2.) das Vorgehen des letzten Beitrags zur Ableitung gehebelter Produkte auf USD- und EUR-Indizes für diese Regionen genutzt wird, 3.) welche Parameter für die Simulation von Buy-and-Hold- und Moving-Average-Strategien mit diesen Produkten gewählt wurden, und 4.) welche Resultate Investitionen in gehebelte Regionen im Vergleich zum Seligen Amumbo gebracht hätten, wenn diese Produkte am Markt (Europe: A0X8ZT; Emerging: ETF128) geblieben wären oder überhaupt existiert hätten.

Wie in jedem Beitrag hoffe ich, euch ein robustes Vorgehen vorstellen zu können, wobei mir jedoch wichtig ist, dass ich euch *mein* Vorgehen erläutere und *keinerlei* Anspruch auf analytische Universalität erhebe. Zwar bemühe ich mich, alle Schritte und Annahmen so nachvollziehbar wie möglich zu erläutern, sofern jedoch Fragen bestehen oder etwas unklar geblieben ist, zögert bitte nicht nachzufragen.

**Schwarze Künste der Quadratur – Renditen aus dem Nichts**

Im Zuge des letzten Beitrags habe ich mich gefragt, welche Effekte von den Regionen auf die Struktur des MSCI World ausgehen, wie sie sich über die Zeit verändert haben und welche Lehren sich für den Seligen Amumbo in der kurzen und langen Frist ergeben – anders ausgedrückt: Es hat mich gejuckt, leichte Kost ohne große Vorarbeiten zu basteln. Jedoch hat mir die MSCI Inc. einen dicken Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht: Einerseits gab es die Preisindizes der MSCI-Regionen auf täglicher Basis erst ab dem 01-01-1997, andererseits ist ein Großteil der MSCI-Daten in den letzten Tagen in Subscription-Archive verlagert worden, womit sich der Zugriff auf Tages-, Monats- oder Jahresdaten schwierig gestaltet... Zum Glück lagen die Analysen und Ergebnisse ab dem 01-01-1975 zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits auf der Platte. Jedoch habe ich keine Kopie der Preisindizes angelegt, weshalb ich aktuell keine Optimierung der Schätzung entwickeln kann. Ähm, wo ist das Problem?

Naja, es ist relativ simpel: Leider lagen mir für die Preisindizes der vier MSCI-Strukturen (World, North America, Europe und Pacific) nur Monatswerte für die Zeit vom 31-12-1969 bis 31-12-1996 vor; die Daten für den MSCI Emerging sogar erst ab dem 31-12-1987. Darüber hinaus gab es die Rekonstruktion des täglichen Preisindex für den MSCI World aus dem letzten Beitrag, sodass ein Problem fehlender Werte vorliegt. Aha, aber wo nichts ist, kann ja was werden, oder? Ja, aber das heißt, die fragilen Mächte der Imputation anrufen zu müssen. Aha, und wie? Konkret greifen wir auf, dass die Industrieregionen als Elemente und die Schwellenländer als Gegenpol ein hohes Maß direkter und indirekter Dependenz zum MSCI World aufweisen, was sich u.a. in der Korrelations- oder Kovarianzstruktur ausdrückt und eine Disaggregation der Monatsrenditen auf Basis täglicher Referenzen erlaubt. Äh, bitte was?

Im Grunde ist unser Ziel, Tagesrenditen der Subindizes zu schätzen, deren Verlauf die kleinste Abweichung zum MSCI World aufweist bzw. ihrer Relation so präzise wie möglich folgen. Hierfür nutzen wir einen Constraint Quadratic Approach (Wolfe 1959 & Bertsekas 1996), der uns eine plausible Schätzung der Tagesrenditen für jeden Subindex auf Basis der Monatsrenditen Rₘ und den Tagesrenditen des MSCI World rₕ über die Minimierung einer quadratischen Distanzfunktion liefert. In der Praxis sind die Ergebnisse lineare Verschiebungen des MSCI World, weshalb wir den Constraint setzen, dass die Summe der täglichen Renditen exakt den Monatsrenditen der Subindizes entsprechen muss (Aggregationskonsistenz). Glücklicherweise ist diese lineare Projektion durch einen Lagrange-Multiplikators (Bertsekas 1989) lösbar:

[Constraint Quadratic Approach via Lagrange-Multiplikation](https://preview.redd.it/075bh58c6utf1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7fb49b72a8bd0cfe2cfd92bfed9b14ae421a80)

Ausgehend von dieser Schätzung täglicher Renditen ist es möglich, den Verlauf der Preisindizes jeder MSCI-Region abzuleiten, jedoch setzen wir davor eine Grid Search-Prozedur zur Ermittlung eines Skalierungsfaktors ein, der gewährleisten soll, dass die Simulation der Preisindizes stets auf dem realen Indexendwert oder marginal niedriger liegt – wir sprechen von sehr kleinen Werten, die eine lineare Korrektur der Renditen bewirken, die unsere Simulation jedoch kumulativ verzerrt hätten (North America: -2.97×10⁻⁵; Europe: -5.08×10⁻⁵; Pacific: -5.59×10⁻⁵; Emerging: -4.91×10⁻⁵). Zur Konstruktion vollständiger Zeitreihen werden die Disaggregationen jedes Subindex mit den realen Renditen ab dem 01-01-1997 zusammengeführt, wobei die lineare Korrektur nur in den simulierten Bereichen vor 1997 eingesetzt wird.

Im Hinblick auf dieses Vorgehen ist zu beachten, dass der Lagrange-Multiplikator eine lineare Verschiebung der Renditen um den Faktor λ bewirkt und wir diese Prozedur auf Prior-Angaben für Korrelationen, Kovarianzen und Interaktionen (Honaker & King 2010) hätten ausweiten können, wäre ich schneller gewesen. Insofern liegen uns zwar plausible Schätzer für die Zeit vor dem 01-01-1997 vor, jedoch fehlt eine kleine Stochastik zur präziseren Abbildung der Kursvariabilität, was eine Glättung der Indexverläufe bewirkt – methodisch ist es eine Art grober Stineman-Interpolation auf Basis spärlicher Stützstellen (Stineman 1980) und liefert ab, aber ich habe längere Zeit gehadert, die Simulation zu starten. Naja, es ist, wie es ist...

Während der Analyse war ich leider nicht so geistesgegenwärtig, eine Visualisierung zu erstellen, weshalb ich euch lediglich eine Proof-of-Concept-Reproduktion mit Daten vom 01-01-1995 bis 31-08-2025 anbieten kann. Hierfür habe ich Tagesrenditen der Subindizes ab dem 01-01-2011 sowie die Monats- und Tagesrenditen des MSCI World ab dem 01-01-1995 als Referenz genutzt – in anderen Worten ausgedrückt, simulieren wir, dass es keine Tageswerte der MSCI-Regionen vor dem 01-01-2011 gibt und wir diese jedoch nun so genau wie möglich rekonstruieren wollen:

[Constraint Quadratic Approach Simulation](https://preview.redd.it/fv0k1vv41rtf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dbf86146c35a6347d175e7acaa4c160b8fca266)

Im Anschluss an die Simulation der Preisindizes in US-Dollar ist es möglich, alle Index-Varianten für die vier Regionen in US-Dollar und Euro über die Methodik des letzten Beitrags abzuleiten, was uns die Grundlage für gehebelte Produkte liefert. Hierzu gehen wir von regulären Kapitalzinsen (USD: DFF/SOFR; EUR: FTG/EONIA/€STR) und Total Expense Ratios aus, die den Eigenschaften früherer Produkte entlehnt sind oder auf Schätzungen basieren (Nordamerika: 0.5% p.a.; Europa: 0.5% p.a.; Pazifik: 0.7% p.a.; Emerging: 0.8% p.a.):

[Vergleich gehebelter Produkte auf das MSCI-Universum](https://preview.redd.it/li8lcwvb1rtf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=800fce8c87f7e36b629edad8eaba8788ec975bd9)

In der Regel gehen wir von Nettodividendenindizes in US-Dollar zur Konstruktion der gehebelten Produkte aus, jedoch habe ich den EUR-Index für das Europa-Produkt gewählt, um die Simulation für diese Region realistisch zu gestalten. Aha, wieso? Naja, es wäre in vielen Ländern steuerlich ungünstig oder unattraktiv, gehebelte Produkte auf diesem Markt in US-Dollar zu basteln; der Heilige Amumbo ist ja gerade durch diese Region-Währung-Divergenz und seine Verwendbarkeit in Vorsorgedepots so einzigartig. Vermutlich wird es jedoch Leute geben, die sich fragen, wie sich ein Produkt auf Euro- oder USD-Indizes verhalten hätte, weshalb ich die Simulation für alle Regionen und den MSCI World in beiden Varianten aufgesetzt habe – ich füge euch die Resultate als Tabellen im Verlauf des Beitrags ein. Alles klar!? Weiter geht's...

**Kaufen, Halten, Beten – Supreme Regional Edition**

Nun liegen uns alle Elemente für die Analyse vor, sodass wir einen Blick in die Dynamik der Regionen werfen und sie in einen Vergleich zum Seligen Amumbo setzen können. Hierfür gehen wir von den gleichen Settings wie im letzten Beitrag aus. Ähm, heißt jetzt was? Das heißt, dass wir Nominalrenditen betrachten, die gemäß aktueller Steuergesetzgebung über Kapitalertragssteuer, Verlusttöpfe, Freibeträge und Vorabpauschale besteuert werden. Im Hinblick auf den Handel wird ein Spread von 0.5% angesetzt und wir gehen zur Vereinfachung davon aus, dass Bruchstücke gehandelt werden können. Wir betrachten Einmalanlagen (Lump Sum) und Sparpläne (DCA), wobei wir gleitende Zeitfenster von 10, 20, 30 und 40 Jahren zur Berechnung der Verteilungen der True Time Weighted Rates of Return und der Maximum Drawdowns als Rendite- bzw. Risikometrik nutzen.

Leider gibt es harte Grenzen für Grafiken und Zeichen in Beiträgen, sodass ich mich bei Visualisierungen auf Anlagen per Sparplan fokussiere – sofern euer Herz für Einmalanlagen schlägt, findet ihr die Ergebnisse in den Tabellen und die Grafiken im Repository. Darüber hinaus lege ich den Schwerpunkt der Interpretation auf Nordamerika und halte den Rest der Welt kürzer, um alles in einem Beitrag behandeln zu können. Alles klar, sehen wir uns mal an, was der Simulator ausgespuckt hat...

[Empirische Verteilung von Rendite- und Risikometriken für Buy-and-Hold-Strategien](https://preview.redd.it/ift4obx11rtf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf73e79e5c4f1ca6307b6614e6c7eaf66a112d5)

Im Wesentlichen zeigen die vier Regionen in den Boxplots (Spear 1952) dieselben Trends, die wir bereits im letzten Beitrag für Buy-and-Hold-Anlagen beobachtet haben: So wären die mittleren Renditen (Mediane) über die mittleren Horizonte leicht gesunken, bevor sie über lange Horizonte angestiegen wären. Gleichzeitig hätte sich die Streuung der Verteilungen verringert, was einerseits auf kleinere Stichprobengrößen bei längeren Horizonten und ihre Neigung zu homogeneren Verteilungen, andererseits auf die glättende Wirkung des Long Bias von Aktienmärkten, der sich bei gehebelten Produkten verstärkt, zurückzuführen ist. Ähnliche Trends wären auch bei den Maximum Drawdowns zu beobachten gewesen, da die Streuung der Ergebnisse in Abhängigkeit von der Investitionsdauer abgenommen hätte, während gleichzeitig die Mediane der Verteilung gestiegen wären – eigentlich keine neue Erkenntnis, oder?

Eigentlich ist es wenig überraschend, dass sich Nordamerika als eine, später die Säule des globalen Aktienmarkts nahtlos in diese Trends einfügt: So weist die Region das stabilste Renditeprofil der Weltregionen auf, wobei die Medianrendite für den Bereich von 10 Jahren bei 10.4% bzw. 10.3% p.a. (LS bzw. DCA) gelegen hätte, was deutlich unter den Renditen des Seligen Amumbos rangiert hätte (12.4% bzw. 12.3% p.a.) - eine Ursache für diese Differenz ist der starke Impuls des Pazifikraums in der frühen Phase der Simulation, der sich in seiner Zeitdynamik deutlich vom späteren Aufstieg Nordamerikas unterscheidet. Im Hinblick auf längere Zeiträume hätte eine Stabilisierung der Mediane eingesetzt (LS: 9.2% bis 11.0% p.a.; DCA: 9.2 bis 10.9% p.a.), was leicht über den Renditen gehebelter World-Produkte gelegen hätte. Hinsichtlich der Streuung (IQR = Q3 - Q1) fielen die Unterschiede relativ klein bzw. marginal aus, was sich aus der strukturellen Dominanz des US-Markts im globalen Aktienmarkt ergibt.

Im Vergleich dazu lagen Europas mittlere Renditen stets im Bereich der globalen Referenz (LS: 8.3% bis 11.2% p.a.; DCA: 8.3% bis 11.6% p.a.), wobei sie bei Anlagen von 10 bis 20 Jahren knapp 0.6 bis 0.7 Prozentpunkte p.a. unter der Referenz, bei längeren Anlagen ab 30 Jahren jedoch 0.4 Prozentpunkte p.a. über dem Seligen Amumbo gelegen hätten. Ähnlich verhält es sich bei der robusten Streuung, deren Differenz zur globalen Benchmark bei 0.2 bis 1.9 bzw. 0.3 bis 1.9 Prozentpunkte p.a. gelegen hätte.

Jenseits der stabilen Regionen liegt das Reich der Volatilität: Anhand des obersten Quartils und des Maximums des Pazifikraums (21.6% bzw. 45.2% p.a.) wird deutlich, welches Ausmaß das Excess Momentum in der Bubble-Ära erreicht hätte und welcher Abstieg für Anlagen in diese Region bei mittleren Renditen von 5.8% bis 3.8% p.a. erfolgt wäre. Vergleichbar volatil wären Anlagen in die Emerging Markets ausgefallen, deren Medianrenditen mit 5.9% bis 3.7% p.a. (10 bzw. 30 Jahre) ebenfalls unter der globalen Referenz gelegen hätten – in beiden Regionen gibt die Simulation extrem rechtsschiefe Verteilungen aus, sodass ein gehebeltes Buy-and-Hold für diese Produkte kaum Vorteile geboten hätte.

Allerdings ist die Rendite lediglich eine Seite der Medaille, sodass wir den Blick auf die Maximum Drawdowns richten, um weitere Einsichten über Buy-and-Hold-Anlagen zu erlangen: Hierbei weist Nordamerika Mediane von 59.3% bis 90.9% (LS) bzw. 58.8% bis 90.2% (DCA) auf, was knapp 3.2 bis 5.5 Prozentpunkte über den Werten gehebelter World-Produkte gelegen hätte, während sich Europa (LS: 59.6% bis 89.1%; DCA: 58.9% bis 88.6%) lediglich 1.2 bis 4.0 Prozentpunkte über der globalen Referenz bewegt hätte. Erneut wären der Pazifikraum (LS: 81.2% bis 94.2%; DCA: 65.7% bis 90.6%) und die Schwellenländer (LS: 85.1% bis 94.9%; DCA: 72.6% bis 83.0%) eine eigene Vola-Liga gewesen, wobei zu beachten ist, dass die Stichprobengröße der Schwellenländer durch das Startdatum 01-01-1988 niedriger ausfällt, was einen Optimistic Bias in die Verteilung einbringt.

Naja, jetzt habe ich den Fokus lediglich auf Mediane und IQRs gelegt, aber die Extreme aus Gründen der Übersichtlichkeit ausgeblendet, weshalb ich euch hier die vollständigen Tabellen der Risiko- und Renditemetriken für Produkte auf USD- und EUR-Indizes nachliefere:

[Empirische Verteilung von Rendite- und Risikometriken für Einmal- und Sparplanlagen \(Buy-and-Hold USD-Basis\)](https://preview.redd.it/6zcp15oj1rtf1.jpg?width=4025&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbe42acc16838e53458e0a86e6dfa371d4d4c41e)

[Empirische Verteilung von Rendite- und Risikometriken für Einmal- und Sparplanlagen \(Buy-and-Hold EUR-Basis\)](https://preview.redd.it/9n8b7vyl1rtf1.jpg?width=4025&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=107dd867e12196a0efd3003846cc19772e5100d6)

Was heißt das jetzt? Im Rahmen einer Buy-and-Hold-Strategie wäre ein gehebelter MSCI World wohl die beste Wahl im Hinblick auf Risiko und Rendite gewesen. Zwar hätte Nordamerika leicht höhere Renditen geboten, was jedoch stets von höheren Drawdowns flankiert worden wäre; Europa wäre lediglich in Form eines EUR-Index-Produkts eine Alternative gewesen, während die volatilen Ausschläge im Bereich des Pazifikraums und der Schwellenländer sowohl risiko- als auch renditeseitig ineffizient gewesen wären – oder den Investoren eine harte Lektion in Stoizismus erteilt hätten. Wichtig ist jedoch, dass Sparpläne in allen Regionen über alle Zeiträume das Risiko gesenkt und die Nerven geschont hätten.

**Goldlöckchens Expedition durch globale Volatilität**

Naja, wie wir gelernt haben, ist die Rendite von gehebelten Buy-and-Hold-Anlagen relativ gut, jedoch ist die Kehrseite hohe Drawdowns, und vielen Anlegern ist das Risiko schlicht zu hoch, weshalb sich gerade für gehebelte Anlagen aktive Strategien auf Basis gleitender Durchschnitte (Moving Averages) großer Beliebtheit erfreuen. Hierbei soll eine Separation des Marktes in Auf- und Abwärtsphasen helfen, die größten Drawdowns zu reduzieren oder sogar zu vermeiden. Dazu wird lediglich der Durchschnitt ungehebelter Basisindizes über eine fixe Anzahl an Tagen benötigt – oder grob vereinfacht: Liegt der Basisindex zum Börsenschluss über dem Durchschnitt, wird das Produkt am nächsten Börsentag gekauft; liegt er darunter, wird es verkauft. Soweit klar, oder!?

In der Simulation der MSCI-Regionen nutzen wir die ungehebelten Basisindizes in US-Dollar und Euro als Signal für den Ein- und Ausstieg, wobei wir ein Spektrum von 10 bis 600 Tagen bei Berechnung gleitender Durchschnitte einsetzen:

* MSCI World Net Total Return USD (MSCI-Code: 990100; Type: NETR, [MIWO00000NUS](https://www.investing.com/indices/msci-world-net-usd))
* MSCI North America Net Total Return USD (MSCI-Code: 990200; Type: NETR, [MINA00000NUS](https://www.investing.com/indices/msci-north-america-net-usd))
* MSCI Europe Net Total Return EUR (MSCI-Code: 990500; Type: NETR, [MIEU00000NEU](https://www.investing.com/indices/msci-europe-net-eur))
* MSCI Pacific Net Total Return USD (MSCI-Code: 990800; Type: NETR, [MIPC00000NUS](https://www.investing.com/indices/msci-pacific-net-usd))
* MSCI Emerging Net Total Return USD (MSCI-Code: 891800; Type: NETR, [MIEF00000NUS](https://www.investing.com/indices/msci-em-net-usd))

Sofern ich es nicht explizit angebe, handelt es sich um Kalendertage, nicht um Handelstage. Ähm, wie jetzt? Wie im letzten Beitrag erläutert, ergibt sich dies aus der Methodik und hilft bei der Vereinfachung einiger Berechnungen, hat jedoch nur einen marginalen Effekt auf die Resultate. Soweit so gut, es bleibt zu erwähnen, dass ihr bei der Umrechnung den Faktor 252.25/365.25 ≈ 0.69 nutzen könnt, da z.B. ein Wert von 300 Kalendertagen grob 207 Handelstagen entspricht.

Wie in früheren Beiträgen ist es mir wichtig zu betonen, dass wir uns Ergebnisse von Simulationen ansehen, die sich auf plausible Verläufe der Vergangenheit beziehen, d.h. es ist eine Beschreibung (Deskription) – es wird keine Aussage über Wahrscheinlichkeiten von Risiken und Renditen getätigt (Inferenz) und absolut keine Vorhersage (Prädiktion) über die Superiorität eines Einzelparameters oder Parameterbereichs!

[Empirische Verteilung von Rendite- und Risikometriken für SMA-Strategien MSCI Emerging \(Sparplananlage\)](https://preview.redd.it/5fpf1w1y1rtf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=eda86490bc82f0fd04e3bd79cdb553e68e66977a)

Im Rahmen der regionalen Analyse zeigen sich deutliche Unterschiede in Effizienz und Stabilität von SMA-Werten über die Zeit: In Nordamerika hätte es ein breites Spektrum von SMA-Werten im Bereich von 250 bis 600 Tagen gegeben, dessen höchste Renditen bei 410 Tagen gelegen hätten. Auf Seiten des Risikos wären niedrige, stabile Maximum Drawdowns im Bereich um 400 Tage aufgetreten – beide Aspekte sprechen für die hohe Stabilität langer Trends im US-Markt. Ähnlich ist das Ergebnis für Europa, wobei die Region eine höhere Differenzierung zeigt und stabile Renditen im Bereich von 240 bis 510 Tagen existiert hätte. Hierbei wäre das Optimum bei 290 Tagen anzusiedeln gewesen, während niedrige, stabile Maximum Drawdowns eher im Bereich um 250 Tage gelegen hätten – sofern wir uns noch einmal vor Augen führen, dass gleitende Durchschnitte Volatilitätsregime separieren sollen, fügen sich diese Resultate gut in die Volatilitätshistorie Europas ein.

Erneut wirken der Pazifikraum und die Schwellenländer wie eine andere Welt, denn ihre SMA-Spektren wären deutlich in kurzen Horizonten zu verorten gewesen: Im Pazifik hätte das Optimum für Renditen bei 50 bis 60 Tagen und eine weitere Zone hoher Renditen bei 190 bis 210 Tagen gelegen, wobei letztere auch die Zone kleinster Maximum Drawdowns bedeutet hätte. Hinsichtlich der Schwellenländer hätten Investoren ein dynamisches, aber strukturiertes Muster vorgefunden, denn stabile Medianrenditen wären im Bereich von 40 bis 160 Tagen (Optimum 140 Tage), niedrige Drawdowns im Bereich bis zu 200 Tagen (Optimum 140 Tage) anzutreffen gewesen, was die starke Korrelation von Risiko und Rendite in Zeiten abrupter Trendwechsel und hoher Volatilität widerspiegelt.

Insofern ist deutlich, dass die *Goldlöckchen-Zonen* von SMA-Werten keine universelle Größe (SMA 200) darstellen, sondern eine Ableitung der Marktcharakteristika in Abhängigkeit des Zeitraums sind - jetzt böte es sich abermals an, die Eigenschaft gleitender Durchschnitte zur Separation von Volatilitäts- und Renditeregimen anzusehen, aber das Thema ist Teil der *Principia Amumbo*... Nur so viel: Je höher die Volatilität des Marktes und je kürzer die Trendpersistenz, umso kürzer sind die SMA-Werte, wobei die Indexwährung eine kritische Rolle spielt (siehe Unterschiede der Empirical-Werte bei USD- und EUR-Produkten in den Ergebnistabellen). Ähm, die beste Lösung ziehen, ist ja keine Kunst...

**Trend-Tango der Märkte à la Jackson Pollock**

Natürlich ist das keine Kunst, aber bitte denkt daran, dass wir in diesem Beitrag keine Inferenz oder Prädiktion betreiben, sondern uns lediglich ansehen, wie eine Strategie in der hypothetischen, jedoch plausiblen Vergangenheit abgeliefert hätte. Abgesehen davon handelt es sich bei unserer Auswahl an SMA-Werten um *konditionale Optima* – wir setzen bei der Auswahl ja bei Medianen von Rendite und Risiko an, was in der Regel eine Abweichung von den *Absolutoptima* bedeutet. Zur Verdeutlichung habe ich mir erlaubt, eine Evaluation der SMA-Werte für jede Region aufzusetzen:

Alter, was geht jetzt? Im Grunde ist es relativ simpel: In den Grafiken wird gezeigt, welche SMA-Werte im Verlauf der Zeit zu den höchsten Renditen (linke Seite) oder den geringsten Maximum Drawdowns (rechte Seite) geführt hätten. Hierbei steht die rote Linie für die Optima, die gelbe Fläche zeigt die SMA-Werte im obersten bzw. untersten Dezil (10%) an und die grüne Fläche das höchste bzw. niedrigste Quartil (25%). Ich hoffe es wird deutlich, dass 1.) die Länge der Investition zu einer Stabilisierung des günstigen Wertebereichs führt, 2.) das Spektrum des Risikos in der Regel breiter als das Spektrum der Rendite ist, und 3.) die Selektion über Mediane stabile Ergebnisse für beide Metriken geliefert hätte, jedoch nur in Ausnahmen *Absolutoptima* darstellen. Aha, stabil und effektiv, aber wie hätten sich die SMA-Strategien nun geschlagen?

**Burger Power, Euro Freeze, Bubble Glamour - Globaler Vola-Zoo für Liebhaber**

Sagen wir es mal so: Eigentlich gut, aber es hängt davon ab, was wir uns ansehen! Es ist sicherlich keine Überraschung, dass SMA-Strategien bessere Ergebnisse als Buy-and-Hold-Strategien geboten hätten, aber wie sieht der Vergleich der Regionen-SMAs mit dem World-SMA aus? Nunja, es gibt starke Unterschiede...

Im Hinblick auf Nordamerika (SMA 285) wären mittlere Renditen im Bereich von 12.1% bis 12.5% p.a. (LS) bzw. 10.9% bis 12.0% p.a. (DCA) realisierbar gewesen, was eine 0.2 bis 1.3 Prozentpunkte p.a. niedrigere Rendite als die globale Referenz (SMA 255) für Einmalanlagen bedeutet hätte. Selbst der Einsatz von Sparplänen hätte lediglich eine Reduktion der Differenzen (-0.2 bis 0.7 Prozentpunkte p.a.), jedoch keine Umkehr der Tendenz erreicht. Zentral für diese Unterschiede sind Momenta, wie der Aufstieg und Abstieg der Pazifik-Region, die Nordamerika erst in den langen Horizonten kompensiert hätte, wie die robuste Streuung zeigt (LS: NA 8.6 bis 0.7 pp vs. World 6.4 bis 0.7 pp; DCA: NA 6.1 bis 1.0 pp vs. World 6.1 bis 1.4 pp).

Sofern wir den Blick auf Europa (SMA 200) richten, hätten die Mediane der Renditen im Bereich von 12.5% bis 13.9% p.a. (LS) bzw. 10.1% bis 12.4% p.a. (DCA) gelegen, was in beiden Fällen für Horizonte von 10 bis 20 Jahren unter der Referenz, später jedoch knapp über dem Niveau gehebelter World-Produkte gelegen hätte (Differenz: LS -0.7 bis 0.7 pp; DCA -0.2 bis 0.6 pp). Allerdings trügt die Stabilität der Mediane, da sich die Streuung (IQR) deutlich über dem World-Niveau bewegt hätte (LS: 4.8 bis 12.5 pp; DCA: 1.5 bis 9.7 pp) – oder in Anlehnung an John Malkovich als Marvin Boggs: *„Stabiler Kontinent? Am Arsch!“*

Im Pazifikraum (SMA 140) hätten sich mittlere Renditen von 9.8% bis 13.8% p.a. (LS) bzw. 9.9% bis 13.0% p.a. (DCA) ergeben, womit die Region auf kurze Sicht 1.7 bis 3.4 Prozentpunkte p.a. unter der Referenz, jedoch auf lange Sicht 0.3 bis 0.6 Prozentpunkte p.a. darüber gelegen hätte. Im Wesentlichen sind die hohen Renditen ein Echo der Bubble-Ära, die jedoch ebenso extreme Streuungen von bis zu 24 Prozentpunkten erzeugt hätte. Ähnlich volatil, aber strukturierter hätten sich die Schwellenländer (SMA 95) präsentiert: So hätten die Renditen bei 12.8% bis 15.6% p.a. (LS) und 12.4% bis 14.6% p.a. (DCA) gelegen, was Abweichungen von -2.1 bis 0.4 Prozentpunkten p.a. von der globalen Referenz bedeutet hätte. Die Intensität der Streuungen (LS: 4.2 bis 4.9 pp; DCA: 2.5 bis 4.5 pp) sind typisch für Märkte mit abrupten Regime- und Vola-Wechseln.

Nunja, aber wie sieht es bei der Reduktion der Maximum Drawdowns aus? Wie schlagen sich die Regionen in diesem Kontext? Tja, schauen wir die Region Nordamerika an, so wäre das Risiko auf 40.1% bis 43.5% (LS) bzw. 29.8 % bis 41.8 % (DCA) reduziert worden, womit Nordamerika leicht über dem globalen Niveau gelegen hätte. Ein höheres Niveau hätte sich in Europa (LS: 43.8% bis 46.3%; DCA: 29.5 % bis 46.2%) ergeben, was eine Folge längerer Krisen war. Im Vergleich dazu sind der Pazifikraum (LS: 48.5% bis 51.2%; DCA: 30.3% bis 50.7%) und die Schwellenländer (LS: 32.3% bis 51.9%; DCA: 25.7% bis 43.4%) erneut eine eigene Liga.

Ähm, was sagt mir das jetzt? Im Wesentlichen zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass SMA-Strategien in der *Goldlöckchen-Zone* im Vergleich zum Klassiker (SMA 200) eine Steigerung der Rendite von bis zu 2 Prozentpunkten p.a. und eine Reduktion der Maximum Drawdowns von 3 bis 4 Prozentpunkten erreicht hätte – entsprechend ist die Wahl des Parameters keine Trivialität, sollte jedoch stets in Abwägung der regionalen Vola-Historie erfolgen. Im Vergleich zu Buy-and-Hold-Anlagen hätte die Verwendung gleitender Durchschnitte zu einer starken Reduktion von Drawdowns (Hablierung) ohne Einbußen bei der Rendite geführt. Joa, das ist mal eine nette Kiste...

Erneut wird deutlich, dass der Selige Amumbo eine robuste Balance von Rendite und Risiko bietet, es jedoch sehr hohe Potenziale in den vier Regionen gab – diese spielten sich jedoch in den Extremen der Verteilung ab, die aus Platzgründen ausgeblendet wurden. Es ist jedoch wahrscheinlich, dass weder Buy-and-Hold-Anlagen noch Moving-Average-Strategien in der Lage sind, diese Effekte in voller Stärke aufzugreifen – hierfür wäre ein tieferes Verständnis der Regionen-Momenta nötig. Ähm, und wie kriegen wir das? Indem wir den Blickwinkel ändern…

**Im Fluss der Zeit – Regionalis Motus**

Natürlich sind Tabellen wieder nur eine Seite der Medaille, es fehlt die zeitliche Dynamik, weshalb wir uns ansehen, wie sich der Selige Amumbo und die vier Regionen im Vergleich zur ungehebelten Buy-and-Hold-Anlage in den MSCI World verhalten hätten. Sofern eine Linie für die Rendite (True Time Weighted Rates of Return) über der Nullinie liegt, hätte das Asset für dieses Investitionsfenster eine höhere Rendite als die Referenz erzielt, während wir für das Risiko (Maximum Drawdown) ein Ergebnis unter der Nullinie anstreben:

[Relative Dynamiken der Rendite- und Risikometriken für Sparplanlagen \(Buy-and-Hold; Gleitende Fenster\)](https://preview.redd.it/lvjnufqg2rtf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc37f43b9f217f6361458a5591ced3b8fe020f1f)

[Relative Dynamiken der Rendite- und Risikometriken für Sparplanlagen \(SMA; Gleitende Fenster\)](https://preview.redd.it/3njsf0vj2rtf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c684d6d36ada7a2e47b3f950487ac9b5eb89b2a)

Im Wesentlichen zeigen uns die Spaghetti-Plots, dass die Stabilität von Investitionen mit der Länge der Anlagezeit gestiegen wäre, und bestätigen, dass SMA-Strategien in der Lage sind, Risiken in erheblichem Maße zu reduzieren – beachtet man darüber hinaus, welche Reduktion durch Sparpläne im Vergleich zu Einmalanlagen ermittelt wurde, steht die Mischung aus gleitenden Durchschnitten und Sparplänen aktuell an der Spitze effektiver Strategien für gehebelte Produkte.

Darüber hinaus wird deutlich, dass es für den Seligen Amumbo in einer Buy-and-Hold-Strategie selbst bei langen Horizonten (10 bis 30 Jahre) Phasen gab, die niedrigere Renditen als eine ungehebelte Anlage eingebracht hätten – dies sieht für eine SMA-Strategie deutlich anders aus, denn selbst bei kurzen Zeiträumen von 10 Jahren gibt es nur wenige Phasen, in denen ungehebeltes Buy-and-Hold höhere Renditen geliefert hätte. Zusätzlich gibt es eine deutliche Reduktion von Drawdowns. Ähm, wie sieht's bei den Regionen aus? Naja, mal gibt's Licht, mal gibt's Schatten, denn die Regionen haben eine höhere Volatilität als der Selige Amumbo und die Referenz, wie die starken Ausschläge in beide Richtungen zeigen. Ähnlich sieht es bei den Drawdowns aus, wo keine Region niedrigere Werte als der Selige Amumbo erreicht hätte – ein Ausdruck der höheren Volatilität.

Insofern bleibt mir zu bemerken, dass es höchst unwahrscheinlich ist, dass gehebelte Regionen als Einzelposition über lange Horizonte deutliche Vorteile im Vergleich zum Seligen Amumbo bieten – richten wir den Blick auf den Pazifikraum, wird ersichtlich, welche Auswirkung der Auf- und Abstieg einer Region auf unsere Depots haben könnte, während World-Produkte trotz der Inneffizienz des Pauschalhebels schlicht abliefern. Jedoch ist davon auszugehen, dass sich aktive Investoren bemüht hätten, die Unterschiede regionaler Momenta abzuschöpfen und die Zyklizität ihrer Strategien (z.B. Ausstieg bei SMA-Signal) für eine Verlagerung genutzt hätten. Daher gab es zwar das Risiko einer selektiven Auswahl von Regionen, aber es ist wahrscheinlich, dass Strategien auf Basis von Zyklizität und Momentum eine Überkompensation geliefert hätten – es stellt sich jedoch die Frage, ob diese Überlegung in Zeiten, in denen der Anteil des US-Segments am globalen Aktienmarkt über 70 % beträgt, eine Relevanz hat, oder ob das Momentum des Heiligen Amumbos und Nassen Amumbos gegen alle Wahrscheinlichkeit in den Modus *ad infinitum* schaltet…

Ähm, wovon sprichst du? Ach, ich habe nur überlegt, ob sich die höchsten Renditen nicht eher im Excess Momentum verstecken und wie wir in diese Bereiche gelangen... Wie stark diese Exzesse ausfielen, soll der folgende Telltale-Chart zeigen, der sowohl die Verläufe unserer Produkte (solide Linien) als auch ihre Währungspendants (gestrichelte Linien) im Verhältnis zum Seligen Amumbo zeigt. Seien wir mal ehrlich zu uns, es ist doch relativ wahrscheinlich, dass wir in den 80er und 90er Jahren im Heiligen Amumbo Pazifik-Style gesteckt hätten, oder?

Puh, das war jetzt viel Input! Eigentlich wäre jetzt der Punkt, an dem wir uns den Aspekten der Analyse widmen würden, die ich aus Platzgründen nicht behandelt habe, oder welche Ansätze und Konzepte zur Abschöpfung regionaler Momenta geeignet wären; eventuell sogar für gehebelte Aktien, Anleihen und Rohstoffe. Jedoch sollten wir dafür eine neue Seite unseres Reisetagebuchs aufschlagen, uns erstmal von den Strapazen erholen und mir Zeit für neue Modelle geben! In diesem Sinne: Ich klapp' den Bums jetzt zu... Sobald es neues Material gibt, lesen wir uns im nächsten Teil!

1o1bg2l,all,How Do I Cite Sources?,"Poor paraphrasing and improper citation are the most common reasons for plagiarism accusations. A reliable [plagiarism check](https://plagiarismcheck.org/) tool can help to detect the parts that need referencing and editing, but to make the paper original and ready for submission, we need to learn correct attribution.

# What is a citation?

Citation is a way to show that your writing uses some other works. It may contain direct quotes, paraphrased ideas, or just inspiration from some concepts you have met elsewhere. What is important is that you acknowledge the influence and pay tribute to the original authors.

The citation has to maintain specific rules; sometimes, a violation of them is considered plagiarism, even if you formally reference the source. Formatting standards are especially imperative in academic and scientific domains, so educating oneself on citation principles is vital.

# How to cite

The citation should contain information about the source you took the information from. It is worth mentioning that one can quote and reference not only books, journals, or online publications. Data taken from TV programs, interviews, films, patents, bills, and other documents should also be attributed.

The citation should include

* the title of the source;
* the author;
* the page or pages containing the material you are referring to;
* the date your copy was published;
* the name and location of the publisher / the website URL.

# Citation styles

First and foremost, one should adhere to the professor’s recommendations or the journal’s standards for applying the paper. However, we can outline the citation styles commonly used in education and research.

Any citation style requires including basic information about the source; the difference is in the format and arrangement. Moreover, most of the styles expect one to include a short form in-text citation in the relevant part of the writing and provide complete information about the source in the list after the main part of the paper.

**APA (American Psychological Association)** is used for papers in sciences and education. Order: Author Year Title Publisher

Example: *Backman, F. (2019). Anxious People (1st ed.). Månpocket.* – full citation

*(Backman, 2019, pp. 7–5)* – in-text citation

**MLA (Modern Language Association)** is used for liberal arts and humanities at the undergraduate level.

Order: Author Title Publisher Year

Example: *Backman, Fredrik. Anxious People. 1st ed. Månpocket, 2019.* – full citation

*Fredrik Backman, Anxious People, vols., 1st ed. (Månpocket, 2019).* – in-text citation

**Chicago** is used for business, history, fine arts, and humanities at the graduate level.

Order: Author Year Title Publisher

Example: *Backman, Fredrik. 2019. Anxious People. 1st ed. Månpocket.* – full citation

*Backman, Anxious People.* – in-text citation

**Harvard** (also called the author/date system) is used for humanities, natural and social studies.

Order: Author Year Title Publisher

*Example: Backman, F. 2019. Anxious People. 1st ed. Månpocket.* – full citation

*(Backman 2019)* – in-text citation

There can be insignificant differences in formatting within the style depending on the discipline and the particular educational institution. The guidelines and a citation generation tool can help to heed all the details without being overwhelmed by the rules – simply choose the required style, insert the source information, and copy the type of reference you need.

# In-text citations

In-text citations refer to the source in the actual body of the paper, immediately following the notion one wants to cite. Most commonly, in-text citations include the author and the publication date, mentioned in parentheses *(Backman, 2019, pp. 7–5).* The full form of the citation will be provided in the reference list placed after the main text.

Some citation styles use in-text superscript or bracketed numbers relevant to the corresponding attribution in the reference list. This method is typically applied in the AMA (American Medical Association) style for medical papers.

Other citing styles may require placing an explanation in footnotes or endnotes. This way of referencing is typical for the Chicago style. However, it can also be met in MLA and APA papers, mostly for giving copyright or content details rather than attribution.

# List of references

Papers containing footnotes may not require a detailed bibliography list. Most of the papers, however, do include a list of the used sources:

* it is called List of References in APA and Harvard styles,
* Works Cited in MLA,
* and Bibliography in Chicago style.

One should also note that the List of References includes data on all the sources cited in the work. Meanwhile, the Bibliography contains everything that influenced the author, so one should mention background reading and sources of inspiration, even when they are not quoted or referred to in the text.

Typically, the sources are listed in alphabetical order. However, it may vary according to the style along with the formatting details like italics, capitalization, and punctuation marks.

Suppose one applies a numerical citation style using the numbers in-text. In that case, the reference list is typically ordered according to the appearance of the notions in the paper so that the reader will find the attribution under the number mentioned in the text.

# Latin terms in citing

There are some terms of Latin origin typically used in citing the sources.

* “**Ibid.”** – is short for “ibidem,” which means “in the same place.” Used for indication of the repetitive citing of the same text. For example, we want to refer to the different pages of the same book: *1. Backman, F. (2019). Anxious People (1st ed.). Månpocket, p. 4-9. 2. Ibid., p. 11.*
* **et al.** – is short for “et alia,” which means “and others.” Stands for the list of authors or contributors when there are too many of them to mention, typically applied for more than two authors in APA and more than four contributors in Chicago style. For example, multiple authors’ Oxford Textbook of Medicine can be attributed *(Firth et al., 2020)*.

In the footnotes, instead of “ibid.” one should use “Loc. Cit.” or “Op. Cit.”

**“Loc. Cit.”** – “Loco citato,” or “in the place cited,” applies when we refer to the same place in the same work as the previous citation;

**“Op. Cit.”** – “Opere citato,” or “in the work cited,” applies when we refer to a different part of the work from the previous citation.

# Why should one cite the sources?

1. **Attribution makes your work more credible,** proving that you have studied some sources and consulted solid data.
2. **Citation allows your audience** to get some background reading, dive deeper into the topic, or check your sources to form their own opinion regarding the issue.
3. **Acknowledging your sources,** you thank them for their work and promote healthy collaboration and honesty.
4. **Proper referencing saves your reputation** and ensures you avoid copyright-related problems.

1o50jq1,all,"Why does the Aryan migration theory still spark so much controversy among Indians, specially the Government?","I’ve been reading about the Aryan migration into ancient India, and I keep noticing that this topic generates very strong reactions. Some people insist it’s a “colonial myth” or even a “racist European invention,” while others paint it as a mostly peaceful migrant movement that blended with ancient Indians with almost no fight or oppression at all.

From what I understand so far:

Genetics: Ancient DNA studies (Narasimhan et al., Science, 2019) show Steppe ancestry entering India after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization (around 2000–1500 BCE). This ancestry is more common in northern India and among upper castes, less so in the south.

Linguistics: Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European language family, sharing roots with Greek, Latin, and Old Persian — which seems difficult to explain without some historical population movement.

Archaeology: After the Indus Valley cities declined, we see changes in pottery, burial practices, and settlement patterns. Early Vedic texts even describe interactions (and sometimes conflicts) between ārya and dasa/dasyu peoples.

Social structure: The Rig Veda (10.90) lists the four varnas, which suggests some early form of hierarchy. It’s interesting how these ancient distinctions have been interpreted in modern times, sometimes turning into debates about “pure native origins” and national pride.

It seems that, despite multiple lines of scientific evidence pointing toward migration and cultural blending, discussions about this topic often become extremely defensive. Some of the strongest reactions appear to come from those who want to emphasize India as an entirely self-contained, uninterrupted civilization — which is understandable from a pride perspective, but perhaps not fully aligned with the data.

So my question is:

Why does the Aryan migration topic continue to be so politically and emotionally charged, and apparently heavily censored due to lack of Indian sources about the matter, even in academic discussions.

I’m genuinely curious to understand the sociological, historical, or cultural reasons behind this defensiveness, that in my point of view is really unnecessary, most countries endured harsh subjugations from foreign populations, most of Southern and Eastern Europe was under Muslim occupation for centuries, and suffered under that influence just like India did.

Anyway, I’m not here to argue, just to learn why that specific part of history is so important to Indians to the point of discussing it being almost taboo.",Von_Sauerkraut,2025-10-13 02:27:15,87,0.81,82,169,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/IndianHistory/comments/1o50jq1/why_does_the_aryan_migration_theory_still_spark/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianHistory/comments/1o50jq1/why_does_the_aryan_migration_theory_still_spark/,self.IndianHistory,0,Question,,0,none,[],2513,108,,data science,,,,,Von_Sauerkraut,2023-03-07 07:33:02,698.0,32.0,730.0,False,False,True

How so? By citing these statistics

https://preview.redd.it/m1rmvp9kvbuf1.jpg?width=1145&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=309aaac515c46cdd9f9cff5741e36a589c356a24

Funny thing though - they don't provide any source for this. Now why might that be? Well, turns out it's pretty easy to find, and the facts of the matter might give us some clues.

The numbers come from [**this webpage**](https://studentsforlife.org/learn/abortionrisks/#:~:text=Abortion%20heightens%20the,use%20or%20abuse) on their site, which in turn references [**this blog**](https://care-net.org/center-insights-blog/a-study-of-suffering-after-abortion/), which is referencing this so-called ""[**study**](https://www.jpands.org/vol22no4/coleman.pdf)"" by Priscilla Coleman.

So there's a few things about this ""study"" everyone should be aware of, and possibly why they aren't telling people this is the source of their numbers:

The study in question:

* Used data from an online survey, which is [**known to produce unreliable/flawed results**](https://ianchadwick.com/blog/internet-surveys-bad-data-bad-science-and-big-bias/).
* Collected the data from crisis pregnancy centers, which are [**known propaganda mills**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9189146/).
* Admitted towards the end that the results ""cannot be generalized to the average woman seeking an abortion in the U.S.""
* And the cherry on top? The ""study"" was published by the [**Association of American Physicians and Surgeons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons). Which has also published articles claiming HIV doesn’t cause AIDS, vaccinations cause autism, humans don’t contribute to climate change, and that Obama used hypnosis to sway voters. [**No, seriously.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons#Journal_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons)

So yeah, this might be why they're a bit hesitant to tell you the source for their numbers. Not to mention that the lead author of the ""study,"" Priscilla Coleman, has been repeatedly exposed as an unreliable crank [**again**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363672218_Critique_of_Coleman's_new_study_The_Turnaway_Study_A_case_of_self-correction_in_science_upended_by_political_motivation_and_unverified_findings), and [**again**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9755483/), and [**again**](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66249015), and [**again**](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE82624B/), and [**again**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-guidelines-for-proper-scientific-conduct-ignored/A64BC072E9C1AAE47B4F53119443847F).

1o1lg08,all,"Conversion therapy is being legalized again by SCOTUS, and I have things to say.","The word out of the Supreme Court is that they appear poised to overturn Colorado’s ban on conversion “therapy” or torture as it would be better described. Naturally I have opinions and a few things to say regarding this, so let’s get into it.

I never went through “actual” conversion therapy, as in with a “therapist”, only because I wasn’t out until I was 31. But I did go through things that are equally horrific because I’m trans. I dealt with severe abuse as a child. I was bullied in school. I had pastors lay hands on me and pray over me, trying to get whatever “demon” was inside out of me. That’s the extremely tame version. You can find the full, unredacted version a little further down my profile. My point? None of those things made me not trans. Going to church, talking to “leaders”, hearing everyday that “femininity isn’t for boys” “boys don’t wear that” “God has no use for sensitive men” and in extreme versions even that I was going to hell for it, didn’t help me.

These are some of the same tactics they use in conversion therapy, yes including the physical abuse. None of it helped me. Praying to God everyday to take my gender dysphoria away didn’t help me. Reading the Bible didn’t help me. Reading said bible onto a tape recorder while knelt in my parents bathroom and then listening to it back DID NOT HELP ME.

They will use these tactics, and worse against these kids. My childhood was stolen from me. I never got to be who I really am until much later in life. Now I’m transitioning and thriving, 3 years on HRT almost, 3 years into social transition, I really am living my best life. And it’s a life that they never would’ve let me have, and I had to literally move to another state to get it. I’m from Texas and moved to Colorado this past summer.

Let me be very clear, you are not safe. You are not protected. There are no red and blue states when it comes to this. The law being challenged to SCOTUS in the first place is a Colorado state law, a progressive state with actual trans protections in our constitution, and an openly gay governor who won by double digits twice (Jared Polis). Please do not think just because you’re in California, or Washington state or Oregon or Connecticut or wherever that they can’t get to you. Be vigilant. Protect yourself and your kids.

They are making this as a free speech issue, and I’d like to speak on that for a moment. I work in healthcare, and I have a very real very dedicated passion for my work and for my patients. I take it seriously, and I do the job with pride. I’m a CNA for 3 years now and I’m currently looking into RN programs. If I give one of my patients any sort of medical advice, or even someone online medical advice after saying “I work in the field, you can trust me”, and they follow my advice and it hurts them, I don’t get out of that. I don’t get to say “but free speech?”. Joe Random can stand on the sidewalk with a megaphone and spew whatever pseudo nonsense he wants. If I do it, if any of my friends who are nurses do it, it’s different and it SHOULD BE different. We are charged with the well being of our patients and anyone who comes to us for care. We are and should be held to a higher standard. Joe Random telling people to inject bleach to clean impurities out of their veins is different from me or my coworkers saying it. There’s a reason it’s a crime to impersonate a heath worker. Because people listen to us. If they can’t trust US, then what?

This is not a free speech issue. And this WILL kill kids. And Colorado’s law already has a religious exemption. You can bring your kids to church to have them “prayed over” much like I was as a kid. The law only applies to licensed therapists who are expected to provide medical best practice advice and solutions, for the wellbeing of the patients.

Conversion therapy DOES NOT WORK. The science is in, there’s a reason it’s banned in so many states. It makes kids hate themselves like I did, try to take their own lives like I did, resent their very existence like I did. It will make them depressed. It will strip them of their hope. They will go through life having been taught there’s something wrong with them. That something inside them, who they fundamentally are as a person is broken, something that needs to be “fixed”. It is COLD HARD DATA that this not only doesn’t work, but brings in a litany of new issues. SCOTUS knows that. They acknowledged that. They were shown and cited the studies in yesterday’s oral arguments and their response? Well can we really trust medicine and science now? It’s all gone woke. So just take any science you don’t like or that’s inconvenient for your argument, slap a “woke” tag on it and then you can just ignore it. That’s what SCOTUS is saying. And this will have ripple effects well outside Colorado, and well past conversion therapy and other things. They’re citing free speech. So a therapist in Washington state can now do this. A doctor or nurse in Connecticut will now be able to just say whatever they want, treat patients however they want and the patient will not have a recourse.

Ken Paxton has now initiated an undercover task force to “find transgenders” across Texas. I was miraculously able to get out when I did, and my heart SHATTERS for those still there. But this is following us no matter where we go. Yes, blue states may provide a little bit of a bulwark but NOTHING is guaranteed. You MUST take care of you and yours.

Why am I so concerned about this? I pass. I used the women’s bathroom at a football stadium with 73,000 people in September and nobody even looked up from their phones. I can stealth, my license already says female and in a couple weeks my name change which I already have the court order for will be officially and legally finalized by SSA. I’m also 35, they can’t force me into conversion therapy anyway even if none of the above were true.

The kids who are going to be affected by this, I was them once. I went through similar things they will try to do to you, and they will try also even harsher measures. And unlike mine, yours will have the added effect of being sanctioned by the state. I now would like to speak directly to these kids:

I will not pull the ladder up behind me. I will not go out and and enjoy my brunch while my community burns around me. I will not leave you out to dry, I will not abandon you. We will fight, peacefully and nonviolently for any federal agents reading this post.

I do not have kids. It’s been one of the greatest sources of my depression that I’m unable to become pregnant. I can adopt, and I plan to but for now, now YOU all are my kids. Mama bear protection mode activated.

You are not broken. There is nothing wrong with you. You do not need to be fixed. You need to be loved, cherished, treasured as the beautiful person and soul you are. As long as I’m breathing I will not give up this fight. Get behind me, because we can’t slow down anytime soon, and I won’t. We will fight this through every legal and civil disobedience means. To those agents reading, civil disobedience MEANS peaceful. It’s right in the term, CIVIL disobedience.

To the parents who fought for this, who are celebrating this as a win right now, I now speak to you. You are heartless, and if you can’t bring yourself to love your kid fully, completely and unconditionally EXACTLY as they are you should not be a parent and you don’t deserve these kids. You are unworthy of the title mom, dad, whatever they call you. And I will make it my personal mission to see to it that you cannot hurt them.

You think God wants this? You think God WANTS your kid to hate themselves, to be terrified, not just scared but paralytically TERRIFIED of burning in hell everyday like I was? You think God WANTS them to question their worth, if their parents really love them, no one understands? God doesn’t want that. God wants your kids to be safe. He wants you to love them. He CHARGED YOU with that. And you are failing.

Go ahead and celebrate this. Have a party. Let your kids see once and for all exactly how much you don’t actually love THEM, but the picture of them you’ve painted in your head, YOUR idea of what YOU wanted them to be.

Kids will suffer, kids will die, and you still will be unable to look in the mirror at your own doings. You will blame “the radical left”. I’ve felt how I do since I was 6. I was raised by very conservative Christian parents. Forced to go to church, read the Bible, pray. I didn’t know what “the radical left” was, or that transitioning was something someone could do. I didn’t know there are medical reasons some kids who look like boys feel like girls on the inside and vice versa. I just knew I was different. And I was TORTURED for it. By people who didn’t understand, didn’t TRY to understand, yet claimed to love me.

Congratulations, you have your little Supreme Court victory, if indeed they do rule the way it appears that they will. It will be challenged, we will fight, WE ARE NOT giving up on these kids. We will exhaust you with every legal means possible, and hear me when I say this because I fully mean it, because this isn’t happening on my watch:

1o053p4,all,Patent data reveals what companies are actually building with GenAI,"An analysis of 2,398 generative AI patents filed between 2017 and 2023 shows that conversational agents like chatbots make up only 13.9 percent of all GenAI patent activity.

I thought it would be taking the top sport which is actually taken by Financial fraud detection and cybersecurity applications at 22.8 percent. Companies are quietly pouring way more R&D dollars into using GenAI to catch financial crimes and stop data breaches than into making better chatbots (except OpenAI, Anthropic and other frontier model companies I think).

Even more interesting is what's trending down versus up. Object detection for things like self driving cars is declining in patent activity so not sure if autonomous vehicle tech is in place or plans of implementing them are loosing traction. Same with financial security apps, they're the biggest category but showing a downward trend.

Meanwhile, medical applications are surging and using GenAI for diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery went from relative obscurity in 2017 to a steep upward curve by 2023

The gap between what captures headlines versus where actual innovation money flows is stark with consumer facing tech getting all the hype but enterprise applications solving real problems like fraud detection getting bulk of the funding.

The researchers used structural topic modeling on patent abstracts and titles to identify these six distinct application areas. My takeaway from study is that the correlations between all these categories were negative, meaning patents are hyper specialized. Nobody's filing patents that span multiple usecases and innovation is happening for specialised and focused use.

1o1hrxo,all,Music metadata matters a lot more than you think,"**Quick profile**

10+ years Sr. Data Scientist, served across many domains, working on optimization models and recommendation models within the Music streaming industry.

\---

I would like to share about something that's probably costing you listeners, and it has nothing to do with how good your music is. I work with streaming data, and I keep seeing the same problem:  Talented artists are releasing great music that nobody can find - not because the songs aren't good, but because the underlying data has problems.

***3M+ songs get uploaded every month***. Your track is competing with all of that. And it's not exclusively based on your music quality, but how your data is presented.

**---**

**The Stuff That's Breaking Your Reach**

**Artist disambiguation** is a real problem. If you share a name with another artist, your catalog can get mixed with theirs. Someone looking for your indie rock might find a collection that includes K-pop, jazz, and metal from different artists using the same name. Most listeners won't sort through it - they'll just leave. Some distributors give the option of attaching an ISNI (standardized ID for musicians) value to your stage name so it will ensure it'll group your tracks together into a dedicated artist profile.

**Missing credits limit your reach**. When you don't credit your producer, engineer, or session musicians, you're cutting off discovery paths. Someone who follows your producer's work might never find you. Incomplete credits also create royalty distribution issues and signal a lack of professionalism to industry professionals. The more credits you provide, the stronger your 'track' profile will become (even breaking down each member's work by instruments!).

**Language classification errors are common**. For example, I see Portuguese songs tagged as English. English-speaking listeners hit play, realize it's not what they expected, and skip. The algorithm interprets those skips as low engagement. It doesn't understand the song reached the wrong audience - it just stops recommending it.

**Genre misclassification has the same effect**. Tag your ambient electronic track as rock and you're serving it to people expecting something different. They skip. Your engagement metrics drop. The algorithm reduces your reach accordingly.

Search accessibility matters. Voice search through Siri and Alexa is increasingly common. **Titles with excessive special characters, complex scripts, or generic names shared by dozens of other songs become difficult to discover**. You can be creative with titles while still keeping them accessible.

**Release dates affect eligibility**. Incorrect release dates can exclude you from new music playlists, create issues with discography organization, and potentially cause licensing complications. What if your song gets covered, how can one determine who released first to determine royalty payment?

**---**

**Here's What Actually Happens to Your Music**

Every streaming platform is drowning in new uploads. Music ops teams can only manually review a tiny fraction of what comes in. Everything else goes through automated checks - basically machine learning tools looking for the worst offenders in terms of quality or legal issues.

After that, your music hits the recommendation pipeline. And this is where metadata becomes everything.

If your data is clean: Your song gets indexed correctly. It shows up in the right genre and language categories. The recommendation engine can actually understand what your song is: who made it, what it sounds like, who else worked on it. You get surfaced in algorithmic playlists. People searching for music like yours can actually find you.

If your data is broken: Your song gets indexed wrong: wrong artist page, wrong genre, maybe doesn't even show up in searches properly. The recommendation algorithm has incomplete information, so it has no confidence about where to place your music. You get skipped for playlists. Your search ranking is terrible. Even people actively looking for you might not find you.

In Data Science, we have a phrase for this phenomena: garbage in, garbage out. These algorithms read your metadata before any human hears your music. If the data's wrong, you're invisible.

\---

**What This Actually Costs You**

Let me give you a concrete example—this is hypothetical, but based on patterns I see constantly.

Say you're an emerging artist with about 1,000 real fans.

With good metadata: Your song lands in 50 algorithmic playlists. You hit 100,000 streams in the first month. That's roughly $300-400 in your pocket. More importantly, you've got momentum going into your next release.

With bad metadata: You're in maybe 5 playlists because your genre and language tags are wrong. You get 10,000 streams and make $30-40. Worse, the algorithm now thinks your song doesn't resonate (because it showed it to the wrong audience), so it stops trying. You've lost $270-360 per song, and you've lost momentum.

And it's not just streaming money:

* Playlist curators (both algorithmic and human) skip over songs with messy metadata
* Sync licensing for TV, film, or ads requires clean data—they won't even consider you otherwise
* Other artists and producers find collaborators through credit searches—if your credits are incomplete, you're not in that network
* Labels and management look at metadata quality as a signal of professionalism

The worst part? It compounds. Streaming algorithms are cumulative.

Bad data early on creates a cycle:

poor placement → fewer streams → algorithm thinks your music isn't good → even fewer streams.

It gets harder to recover the longer it goes on.

***I'm not saying metadata fixes everything.*** You still need to market yourself, build a fanbase, play shows, stay active on socials. But metadata is foundational. Without it, everything else you're doing has to work twice as hard.

\---

**What You Actually Need to Get Right**

Before you release anything, go through this list. The non-negotiables:

* Get your artist identity straight. Work with your distributor to verify your unique artist ID. Use the exact same spelling everywhere. If there's another artist with your name, figure out disambiguation now, not after you've released five songs.
* Credit everyone. Songwriters, producers, performers, engineers, featured artists—all of them. It's not just fair, it's strategic. These credits create discovery networks.
* Be honest about genre and language. Tag your music where YOUR actual fans would look for it. Don't try to game the system by tagging your niche electronic track as ""pop"" just because pop gets more streams. It backfires.
* Get the release date right. This affects playlist eligibility and algorithmic considerations. Double-check it.
* Make your title searchable. You can be creative, but don't make it impossible for voice assistants to find you.

**Additional stuff that significantly helps:**

* Submit your lyrics. This is huge and most people skip it. Lyric search is massive now - people search by ""that song that goes..."" and if your lyrics aren't in the system, you're invisible to those searches. Especially important if your song has a catchy or memorable line.
* Get your ISRC, ISNI and UPC codes right. These track your royalties and analytics. Mess them up and you're losing money.
* Tag your collaborators properly. Featured artists should be tagged, not just mentioned in the title. It activates the network effect (i.e. you'll be likely recommended in another artists' profile)

**Stuff that gives you an edge:**

* Invest in your cover art. Good design matters. Some platforms support animated or video art - use it if you can. Algorithms actually use visual data for recommendations. Also, consistent branding across releases helps with algorithmic artist clustering.
* Fill out your artist profile completely. Bio, social links, website - all of it. The more complete your presence, the better you compete.
* Check platform-specific requirements. Apple Music and Spotify don't use the same metadata standards (excluding the universal standards like ISNI, which is used by everyone). Some regions need different language variants. Most distributors have validation tools - use them.

This takes maybe 15 minutes per release. The return is potentially thousands of extra streams over your song's lifetime.

1o4s2u1,all,Write up on the Crimson Harvest 2025 event sites,"There seems to be some demand for detailed information about the various event sites. So I thought I write it up including fit/fitting advice. It’s not exactly rocket science but there are some details nevertheless. Let’s start off with some basic information:

It does slightly matter which group you choose. Depending on the group you get points for either the Crimson Gauntlets or Tetrimon Bases. (But you can run and get loot from both.)
Some hulls do better in one or the other. So if you are heavily invested in one training route you might prefer one or the other. Laser boats will do better in Crimson Gauntlets and thus choose to work for Tetrimon. Kin locked ships such as ships using hybrids or soft locked missiles will rather want to shoot Tetrimon and thus work for the Blood Raiders. Projectiles might do either. Drones struggle but the Gila can run both sites.

With that out of the way, there are essentially three activities in this event: hacking data sites, the ‘new’ Biocybernetic Incidents, and the ‘old’ Crimson Gauntlets/ Tetrimon Bases. The latter had an escalation added this year (is the barghest bonus spawn new?).

Each of those contribute to your event points and you can decide to only do one. The final reward of 75 PLEX is pretty substantial at current plex prices imho and, if you do the event, you probably aim to get to that therefore.

The data sites are pretty straight forward and imho probably even the most worthwhile. The hacking game is on the more difficult side best bring a T2 (data) analyzer and a bonused hull. There are also event boosters which improve hacking and scanning so if you want to spend an afternoon/evening on the event doing this you might as well pop one. (With blackglass + T2 or zeugma it should be trivial as always.)

For new players who want to run the combat sites, I have the advice to run them with a friend to make them much easier. Consider to pick different ‘teams’ so that you don’t compete for points.
Multiboxing, I consider tedious in those sites but is of course possible. But I would rather stick an alt into an Ishtar in a Haven.


## Details for the Crimson Gauntlets and Tetrimon Bases

Those sites are anomalies (green sites). When you warp to them, a beacon appears on the overview for everyone in the system to see and warp to. (Relevant for hunters and being hunted.)

The layout consists on a warp-in area with NPCs already present. There are two acceleration gates. The ‘shortcut’ needs a key ( [Crimson Gauntlet Shortcut Keypass](https://everef.net/types/90118) and [Tetrimon Base Shortcut Keypass](https://everef.net/types/90117)) which you can buy through contracts, find in the hacking sites, or as loot in the battleship in the site. The shortcut lets you skip one room.

The other gate becomes active when you clear all NPCs. The next room also has a gate which becomes active once you cleared two waves of NPCs. But there are three waves (and sometimes it doesn’t already become active after two waves).

You can also have a `Wrecked Avalanche` present (it’s close to the gate a bit to the right). If you approach that, you get a spawn of Ventures, then of Garmurs, and finally a Barghest which drops some loot. 

After that room, you have the final room with two or three waves before the final battleship with loot. The battleship sometimes spawns while you’re still busy with the last wave or even with it. Those are obviously the most dangerous spawns. Once the battleship is destroyed, a Decloaked Tetrimon / Dark Blood Transmission Relay appears about 15 km ‘north’ of the warp-in point. Destroying it finishes the site and it drops Overseer Sabik Vial / Tetrimonic Warclone Blanks which can be sold to NPC orders (for warclones those NPC buy ordes only exist in blood raider stations in Delve; for vials they are in concord/ded stations which are in empire space). The Barghest and battleship also drop those. The battleship also drops event boosters and various faction items which are very rare drops though (less than with normal faction NPCs or deadspace sites). I did not do a loot statistic. You might want to check https://evejournal.com/runs/event-sites for other people sharing their loot. But be aware that the price estimates are often very very off (as in way too high).

The escalations are ungated without extra rooms. A slightly stronger battleship with loot spawns after several waves.

The waves consist of random NPCs which are either named harvest or tetrimon.

The harvest NPCs are all weak to EM first and foremost and then thermal. They mostly use lasers and thus deal em/thermal with some having additional explosive missiles. There are a lot of neuts & webs. The Blood Raider NPCs have bounties attached in the case of the boss battleship 5 mill. (Tetrimon have no bounties.)

* [Harvest Savior](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56644) frigate, neuts & webs
* [Harvest Follower](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56645) frigate, webs & **scrams**
* [Harvest Shepherd](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56646) frigate, neuts & webs
* [Harvest Exsanguinator](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 60709) frigate, nearly only expl damage
* [Harvest Cleric](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 60708) destroyer, points
* [Harvest Sage](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56670) cruiser, neuts & webs
* [Harvest Prophet](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56647) cruiser, points
* [Harvest Diviner](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56671) battlecruiser, points, some expl
* [Harvest Overseer](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56669) battleship, neuts & webs & points


The tetrimon NPCs also mostly use lasers and thus deal EM/thermal but some have additional kinetic missiles. The resists are more balanced and remember a bit how player ships of the same type would be. The T1 ships are mostly weak against expl/kin while the T2 are weak against thermal/kin. Without having run the numbers, kinetic is probably a decent compromise. They also do a lot of ewar but not only neut & webs but on top tracking/guidance disrupt.

* [Tetrimon Crusader](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56648)
* [Tetrimon Crucifier](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56650) frigate, guidance disrupts
* [Heretic](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 60707) destroyer, points & paints, good bit of kinetic rockets
* [Tetrimon Augoror](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56651) cruiser, remote reps but also deals a little bit of damage
* [Tetrimon Curse](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id= 56653) cruiser, neuts & webs & tracking disrupts, also shoots kinetic heavy missiles
* [Tetrimon Omen](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56652) cruiser, webs
* [Tetrimon Oracle](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56654) battlecruiser, 184 DPS pure EM 
* [Tetrimon Commander](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56674) battleship, webs & points



Barghest extra spawn:

* [Relentless Venture](https://everef.net/types/89132) venture deals EM/thermal
* [Stalking Garmur](https://everef.net/types/89133) shoots pure EM light missiles
* [Unbound Barghest](https://everef.net/types/89966) shoots pure expl cruise missiles

All those NPCs love to target drones. When you fly a Guristas hull, they have enough tank, that you can still use drones *if* you carefully manage them. On other ships I bring a bunch of T1 light drones for emergencies. When I launch them, the NPCs switch to them and make it easier for me to tank.


### Ship suggestions

A fully passive regen tanked Gila works if you manage your drones carefully. I consider this a good option for low skilled char or Ishtar/Gila ratting alts. Videos of example runs: [Crimson Gauntlet in an Gila (with the Barghest extra spawn)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlNTMKN06G4), [Tetrimon Base](https://youtu.be/glluiKGrg2k), [Tetrimon Garrison (Escalation from the Base)](https://youtu.be/nYixJA6jPzE)

Another low skilled option is a RHML praxis (rapid heavy missile launcher). The rapids are painful with the reload but at least you can make the hull work with very very low skills.

Better are heavy assault cruisers and (attack) command ships though. As they are medium sized hulls and apply well to the many smaller targets. Fit them with local repairs and their short range weapon system. A large faction cap battery gives you plenty of cap + resists against neuts. Exact fits vary to how much you might want to manage your cap, if you want to fit a prop mod (which you don’t need) and other tastes.

Some examples are:

The Vagabond has good resists against the incoming damage and you can choose your damage type. Your kin resist is a bit low. Shoot the corresponding targets first. Example runs: [Crimson Gauntlet](https://youtu.be/K5iOrNQJTYw), [Tetrimon Base](https://youtu.be/JMcql7-RhfM)

The Zealot had a recent buff. The lasers deal good damage at good ranges. The EM/thermal damage is especially good in the blood raider sites but also ok against Tetrimon. Example runs: [Crimson Gauntlet](https://youtu.be/Hd8fY3jcs5Q), [Tetrimon Base](https://youtu.be/STbVZcsfCsE)

If you can only use missiles, a Cerberus might be an option for you. The kinetic damage is good against the Tetrimon. So you might want to pick the blood raiders side so you do more tetrimon sites. I haven’t tested it against blood raiders. Example run: [Tetrimon Base](https://youtu.be/WjH1_WDLmG0)

Other HACs should also work. The (attack) command ships are straight upgrades from the HACs. You can easily fit two command bursts which give you a lot of tank bonuses. If you also plug in the implant, your tank will improve by another 10 % or so.

Marauders work of course too. I haven’t tried them myself. Note that the NPCs no longer seem to warp around when you MJD. So MJD + sniping is mostly viable – even though nerfed due to the recent nerf to marauder MJDs. 

Regarding T1 hulls: I tried an Harbinger and it just about didn’t make it. I guess it would be possible to create a fit that works but I just don’t care enough atm. If you cannot fly T2 hulls, I mostly suggest that you team up with another player and you run those sites together. A reasonably fitted T1 battlecruiser should then be ok. (Drekavac and pirate hulls are of course another story.)


## Biocybernetic Incident sites:

* class 1 in a punisher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy8P_6UyGts
* class 3 in a confessor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOdzyYpEHT4

The site has a 10 minute timer; so you cannot do them faster and you probably end up at a bit over 12 minutes. A prop mod is not needed. You face a lot of frigates and want to clear those quickly so that they don't pile up. Therefore damage with good application is king. I did a class 2 in a kikimora without recording it. The kiki's tracking is insane I would expect them to be able to also solo class 3. Otherwise, maybe do them with a friend again and use T1 frigates so that you can enter all sites. The loot wasn't good in my runs. So I decided to stay away from those sites. I simply wanted to check them out. If anyone has different experiences, please tell. btw incoming damage is EM from garmurs and em/thermal from ventures. In class 2 (and 3) you get 1 (and respectively 2) orthrus spawn(s). Those deal expl. Just remove them quickly. The final thingy also deals expl.",ErwinMadelung,2025-10-12 21:01:39,74,0.96,25,99,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Eve/comments/1o4s2u1/write_up_on_the_crimson_harvest_2025_event_sites/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1o4s2u1/write_up_on_the_crimson_harvest_2025_event_sites/,self.Eve,0,Guide,,0,none,"[""https://everef.net/types/90118)"", ""https://everef.net/types/90117))"", ""https://evejournal.com/runs/event-sites"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56644)"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56645)"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56646)"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id="", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56652)"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56654)"", ""http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=56674)"", ""https://everef.net/types/89132)"", ""https://everef.net/types/89133)"", ""https://everef.net/types/89966)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlNTMKN06G4),"", ""https://youtu.be/glluiKGrg2k),"", ""https://youtu.be/nYixJA6jPzE)"", ""https://youtu.be/K5iOrNQJTYw),"", ""https://youtu.be/JMcql7-RhfM)"", ""https://youtu.be/Hd8fY3jcs5Q),"", ""https://youtu.be/STbVZcsfCsE)"", ""https://youtu.be/WjH1_WDLmG0)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy8P_6UyGts"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOdzyYpEHT4""]",11549,48,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzgjez,all,You’re Pitching AI Wrong. Here is the solution. (so simple feels kind of stupid),"I’ll keep it simple. I sell AI. It works. I make 6k a month (profit). Some of you make way more money than me and that’s fine. I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to the ones making $0, still stuck showing off their automation models instead of selling results.

Wake the fck up! Clients don’t care about GPT or Claude. They care about money in, money not wasted, time saved, and less risk. That’s it. When I stopped with the techie talk and sold outcomes, my close rate jumped a ton. Through the damn roof!

I used to explain parameters for 15 minutes. Shit...bad times...I'm sure you do it too. Client said, “Cool. How much money does it make me?” That’s when I learned. Pain first. Then more pain. And then enhance that pain even more. Like a real doctor pressing on your foot when it hurts. You wanna  solve it NOW! So then math gets second. And tech that nobody actually cares about goes last. (Magic)

Here’s how I sell now:

* I ask about the problem. What’s broken. What it costs. Who is stuck doing low value work. I listen.
* Then I do the math with them. In their numbers. Lost leads. Lost hours. Lost revenue. We agree on the cost.
* Then I pitch one clear outcome. “We pre-qualify leads. Your closers only talk to hot prospects.” I back it with proof. Then I talk price tied to ROI. If I miss, they don’t pay. Simple as that. Don't force anyone into a hard close. There is not point. Seriously. You are selling actual business oriented results. Not dating advice or how to lose weight. There is no point doing a discovery call of 40 mins long just to dig out the deeper pains of the prospect. It's about losing money in their business. Either they see it or they do not. 

Stop selling science projects. Clients with real money don’t want to be your test client. They want boring and proven. I chased shiny tools. Felt smart. Sold nothing. What sells is reliability. Clear wins. Case studies with numbers. aaaand proof of the system. “35 meetings in 30 days.” “120k in 6 months.” Lead with that. Tech later. Seriously... try also to not mention about tech at all. You will be amazed! Nobody cares <3. 

You’re not a tool seller. You’re an owner of outcomes. Clients already drown in software. And probalby their later software update will do most of what you are currently promising. They want results done for them. When I moved from one-off builds to retainers with clear targets, price pushback stopped. They pay because I own the number.

When they ask tech stuff, I keep it short: “We use a tested GPT setup on your data. Here’s the result you get.” Then back to ROI. If you drown them in jargon, you lose trust and the deal.

Your message should read like this: clear, bold, direct. Complexity doesn’t sell. Clarity sells.

Do this today:

* Audit your site, deck, and emails. Count AI words vs outcome words. If AI wins, you lose. Flip it.
* Fix your call flow. 70 percent on their problem. 20 percent on your plan tied to outcomes. 10 percent on objections. Most objections vanish when ROI is clear.

How I frame price: “Monthly is $2,000. Based on your numbers, expect 4 to 6x in month one. If we miss the goal, you don’t pay.” Clean. Confident. Manly. And YES... give them their money back if it does not work. ALL of them! And say you are sorry. Do it... don't take blood money. There is no reason about it.

Remember this. People don’t buy the hammer. They buy the house. AI is the hammer. The business result is the house. Sell the house.

Quick recap:

* Outcomes over tech.
* Proven over new toy.
* Owner of results over code monkey.

Do that and you’ll close more. Keep more. Make more. And yes, life gets easier.

See you on the next one.

1o2y9ki,all,From data scientist to a new role ?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 25, currently working as a Data Scientist & AI Engineer at a large Space company in Europe, with ~2.5 years of experience. My focus has been on LLM R&D, RAG pipelines, satellite telemetry anomaly detection, surrogate modeling, and some FPGA-compatible ML for onboard systems. I also mentor interns, coordinate small R&D projects, and occasionally present findings internally.

The context is tough (departures, headcount freezes) and I have an opportunity to move to a large aeronautics company or stay in my team, but grow in scope.

I’m now evaluating two potential next roles (which I might intend as ~2-year commitments before moving on) and would love advice from anyone who has experience with either path:

⸻

Option 1 – AI Product Manager / Project Manager in HR

	•	Deploy 8 AI agents across HR services, impacting ~130k employees.

	•	Lead roadmap, orchestrate AI integrations, and liaise with IT and HR VPs.

	•	Focus on coordination, strategy, and high-level product ownership.

	•	Access to cutting-edge generative AI tools and cloud-based agentic workflows.

	•	High exposure to senior stakeholders and leadership opportunities.

	•	Some political stress: managing expectations of VPs, cross-team alignment, continuous meetings. It is said to be a quite political environment as you deal with HR and not just engineers.

⸻

Option 2 – Big data product owner + AI R&D manager (Tech + Product Ownership) in Space

	•	Merge internal Big Data platforms and integrate AI/analytics pipelines and PO role for a 600 user data lake platform (on premise due to security constraints), coordinating subcontractors.

	•	Manage R&D programs with subcontractors, support bids, and deploy ML models.

	•	some Hands-on technical + coordination (MLops, RAG, keeping 1 data science R&D project as a IC and take subs for the rest), some product ownership.

	•	Exposure mostly internal; less political stress, but operational and technical expectations remain high.

	•	Technical constraints due to working in a defense context: access to cutting-edge AI tools is limited, and infrastructure is slower/more constrained.

	•	Opportunity to remain in the aerospace/space field I’m passionate about, but external market is niche.

⸻

My Considerations

	•	I’m not an elite coder; my strength is prototyping, vision, and leadership rather than optimizing code.

	•	Life-work balance is important; I do ~12–20h of meetings per week currently and enjoy running, cycling, and other hobbies.

	•	Option 1 offers exposure to latest AI technologies and high-level leadership, but comes with political challenges. Also, HR tech is not sexy.

	•	Option 2 is more technical and personally interesting (space), but tools and infrastructure are slower, and the field is more niche. Plus it’s in a crisis in Europe meaning we could have 2-5 years of stagnation.

⸻

Questions to the community:

	1.	If you had to choose between strategic PM exposure with generative AI vs hands-on hybrid tech + product in a niche field, which would you pick early in your career?

	2.	Which path do you think gives the strongest leverage for leadership or high-profile opportunities?

	3.	Any advice on navigating political stress if I take the PM role?

	4.	Are there hybrid ways to make the PM role technically “sexier” or future-proof in AI?

      5.   I am also considering moving into high paid remote roles such as tech sales in the future. Which would work as the best intermediate role ?

Thanks in advance for your insights! Any real-world experience, pros/cons, or anecdotal advice is hugely appreciated.",LocPat,2025-10-10 16:55:55,62,0.88,32,94,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/datascience/comments/1o2y9ki/from_data_scientist_to_a_new_role/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1o2y9ki/from_data_scientist_to_a_new_role/,self.datascience,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],3594,35,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o4bqy4,all,"Dear prof, your AI detector's 98% accuracy is misleading. Here's why with ROC curves and base rates","

I’m a second-year data science student, and after our department started running student essays through an AI detector, I dug into the model card and the published metrics. The headline number they’re touting is 98% accuracy. That sounds great until you unpack the class prevalence and the ROC curve. Quick recap for anyone rusty: the ROC curve plots true positive rate (TPR, aka sensitivity) against false positive rate (FPR, 1 - specificity) at different thresholds. The area under that curve (AUC) tells you how well the model ranks AI-written text above human-written text independent of any threshold. But operationally, a single threshold gets picked, and that choice determines the real-world trade-offs.

The vendor’s whitepaper gives an AUC of 0.91, which is solid for ranking. But they deployed at a threshold that gives TPR ≈ 0.85 and FPR ≈ 0.10 on their validation set. That means they catch about 85% of AI-written texts, but 10% of human-written texts are flagged as AI. That might sound okay until you consider the base rate in our actual submissions.

Let’s do base rate math. Assume in our intro writing class, maybe 5% of submissions are actually AI-assisted (you can argue that number, but the admin survey suggests 3-7%). For a class of 1,000 essays:

\- True AI essays: 50. With TPR 0.85, the detector flags 42 of them correctly.

\- Human essays: 950. With FPR 0.10, the detector incorrectly flags 95 human essays.



Total flags: 42 + 95 = 137. Positive predictive value (PPV) = 42/137 ≈ 31%. So if you get flagged, there is roughly a 69% chance you are actually innocent. That is the base rate fallacy in action: even with a strong classifier, low prevalence and a modest FPR give you a flood of false accusations.

If the prevalence is even lower (say 2%), it gets worse:

\- True AI: 20, flagged 17.

\- Human: 980, false flags 98.

\- PPV = 17 / (17+98) ≈ 15%. So 85% of flags are wrong.

Now, about the ROC/threshold choice. If the university is serious about due process, we should shift to a threshold that minimizes FPR, accepting lower TPR. Suppose we choose a point on the ROC with TPR 0.60 and FPR 0.02 (this is on their curve). With 5% prevalence:

\- True AI: 50, flagged 30.

\- Human: 950, false flags 19.

\- PPV = 30 / (30+19) ≈ 61%. That is still imperfect, but at least most flags are likely AI. And the false positive burden is much more manageable.



Also, accuracy is a misleading aggregate metric when classes are imbalanced. With 95% human and 5% AI, a trivial classifier that always predicts human gets 95% accuracy. So “98% accuracy” without a confusion matrix at the chosen threshold is marketing, not risk assessment.



A few more points that were buried in the appendix:

1) Calibration: The detector’s output scores are poorly calibrated. Reliability plots show overconfidence at the tails. A score of 0.90 does not map to a 90% probability of AI. If anyone is using the raw score as a certainty measure, that is statistically unjustified.

2) Domain shift: The validation data skews to public essays and news rewrites. Our assignments have citations, rubrics, and forced structure. AUC can drop under shift. You need class-conditional performance on in-domain samples, not just a global AUC.

3) Adversarial fragility: Small edits, style mixing, and paraphrasing change scores a lot. The ROC you see on clean synthetic data inflates real-world expectations.



Concrete policy suggestions if we must use this tool:

\- Report confusion matrices at the operational threshold, not just AUC or accuracy. Include PPV and NPV at estimated prevalence rates per course.

\- Set thresholds to cap FPR at or below 2% in low-prevalence contexts. Accept you will miss some positives and use other signals for investigation.

\- Treat flags as leads, not verdicts. Require a human review with content-specific evidence, not a score.

\- Calibrate the scores on in-domain data using Platt scaling or isotonic regression, then publish reliability curves.

\- Re-evaluate prevalence regularly. If prevalence increases, re-tune thresholds to keep PPV acceptable.



TL;DR: A high AUC and 98% accuracy do not mean the detector is fair or reliable in our classes. Base rates and threshold choices dominate the real-world error profile. If we do not adjust for that, we will accuse a lot of students who did nothing wrong.",Mindless-Cellist-853,2025-10-12 06:21:53,67,0.96,7,74,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/CheckTurnitin/comments/1o4bqy4/dear_prof_your_ai_detectors_98_accuracy_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheckTurnitin/comments/1o4bqy4/dear_prof_your_ai_detectors_98_accuracy_is/,self.CheckTurnitin,0,,,0,none,[],4361,99,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o0adbq,all,A word of caution about investing in small-cap pharma,"If you've been paying attention to the world of penny stocks recently, you may have heard of $SPRB, which has just shot up 20x in response to the FDA granting ""breakthrough"" status to its drug. This has understandably got a lot of new investors excited about finding ""the next SPRB"", thinking it's an easy way to make massive returns. I've decided to write this post to give those who might be new to the game a reality check about the dangers of investing in small-cap pharmaceutical companies.

**Don't trust analyst ratings and price targets blindly**

Analyst reports and target prices are often thrown around like fact, but they are based on models, assumptions, and guesses, not inside knowledge of the science. The people publishing those targets are not medical experts, have no special insight into the drug’s chances of success, and are often just working from company press releases. When someone uses target prices to promote a stock, they’re being dishonest by not acknowledging the massive downside risk. 

**Most biotech/pharmaceutical companies fail**

SPRB is more the exception than the norm. The success stories get all the attention, but the vast majority of biotech pipelines fail at various stages (Phase I, II, III, or in regulatory review). In fact, historically over 90% of drugs fail to make it from clinical trials to FDA approval ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9293739/?utm)).

**“Good” results don’t always mean a higher share price**

Even positive trial results can lead to a selloff if the market expected better data, or if the company will now need to raise huge amounts of money for the next phase of trials. Sometimes traders “sell the news” once the uncertainty is gone. The stock you thought would double might actually tank on good data.

**Even if you're right, you can still lose**

You might correctly predict that a drug will *eventually* get approved, but early investors often lose anyway because of dilution. These companies have little or no revenue, so they need to raise money by constantly issuing new shares. Anyone who invested in SPRB earlier than about 3 months ago is still down significantly on their investment.

**Regulatory surprises can destroy years of progress**

Even if a trial meets its endpoints, the FDA can still reject or delay approval for reasons unrelated to efficacy, such as manufacturing issues, incomplete data, or safety concerns. A “Complete Response Letter” can push approval back by years.

**Bad results will make you lose your money in an instant**

When negative trial data or regulatory setbacks come out, the drop happens *instantly*. Stocks can fall 70–90% in the blink of an eye. No stop-loss will save you, the share price will simply gap down.

**Even big pharma companies see steep losses from clinical failures**

This is not just a risk for small-cap names. Large, diversified pharmaceutical companies have seen major share price drops when a trial fails. Just three months ago $LLY dropped 14% in a single day after disappointing results from a trial. The difference? Lilly can take that hit. It has multiple revenue streams, billions in cash, and other drugs in its pipeline. A small biotech doesn’t have that luxury. Many rely on a single drug. If it fails, not only does the share price collapse, the company loses the ability to raise the capital it needs to pivot or continue development and dies.

**Unless you’re a medical expert, you have no edge**

If you’re not a medical professional with specific knowledge of the drug’s target area, holding through trial results is no better than betting on a coin flip. And don't assume that you'll be able to ride the wave up and get out before the collapse. There is no guaranteed announcement schedule. Trial results, press releases, and regulatory decisions are often released unexpectedly without any warning.

**TL;DR**

Small-cap pharma is the most dangerous corner of the market. There is money to be made by riding waves of speculation and picking the right stocks, but there are massive risks that most retail investors aren't aware of. Even good results can tank a stock, and bad ones can destroy it. Don’t trust analyst targets or hype. If you’re not a medical expert, treat these plays like lottery tickets, and cash them fast if you win.",black_cat42,2025-10-07 15:21:21,65,0.93,30,95,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/pennystocks/comments/1o0adbq/a_word_of_caution_about_investing_in_smallcap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1o0adbq/a_word_of_caution_about_investing_in_smallcap/,self.pennystocks,0,:snoo_dealwithit: General Discussion :snoo_dealwithit:,,0,none,"[""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9293739/?utm)).""]",4312,53,,data science,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o1y70q,all,"Gratitude, grit, and generosity","I was looking for a catchy phrase to start out a post about lessons learned. This will do.

The investors in this company are I think a very interesting group of people. Anyone invested for more than a year has seen a lot, and through the many ups and downs of contemplating what is next for the company, it has been on my mind lately to think more about being grateful. What I mean by that is I've been thinking about the good things I've been around, and I've tried to reflect on that a bit more. I find it helpful in better navigating difficult times.

The grit part is all around us. It's life. It's investing. Etc. It is tough being invested in a pre-revenue biotech and it is excruciating to watch the slow process of getting approval for what appears may be an amazing drug for patients! Years ago (2000-ish) I had a position in Immunogen (antibody drug conjugates) before they started getting attention with Genentech Roche and AbbVie. I sold when the Genentech connection was pretty new. I learned from that investment and by selling too early, that timelines on biotech don't speed up just because you like their technology and want to be rich tomorrow. I also remember selling most of my JDS Uniphase position in the tech boom of 1999-2000 at 100% profit, then sold more along the way as it just kept bouncing off the 50 DMA rising to many multiples of my original price. In not very much time, I had sold the last little sliver of a position at 10X my initial price, but if I had more grit at the time, I would have played it differently. You don't get grit without living through things which you later realize have become lessons & stories.

That brings us to generosity and I'm gonna say it out loud. A lot of people here have a lot of resources invested in this stock that could potentially turn into crazy balances. Please take care to find satisfying activities. No one wants to see more of those lottery winners who fall apart. **Long live the CytoDynians***^(©)*

* I am grateful for this board and it's members for being a community of generous learners.
* Grit has come to me along the way over decades. I've been in this stock 5+ years. My mechanism to cope with the waiting is by reading of the developments as much as I can. Well that, and daily life plus some hobbies!
* There are some posters who are very generous with their time. In my own way I've posted a zillion links to resources about the CytoDyn science and news. Here are some other things I noticed recently:
   * the HIV CD02 trial extension was updated with results at [https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02355184?tab=results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02355184?tab=results) on Oct 7
   * IMO the first indirect mention of the TNBC preclinical results of 2025 was in the [Sept 30, 2025 letter to shareholders](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/detail/647/september-2025-letter-to-shareholders) which said ""recent laboratory data generated by Dr. Richard Pestell that appears to reinforce our belief in leronlimab as a paradigm shift in solid tumor oncology. The initial draft of the manuscript will be ready for internal review in the coming weeks."" So, IMO preclinical cancer data may be embargoed until a paper is released and that could, but might not include the preclinicals of glioblastoma, prostate, and TNBC (3 studies) from 2025.
   * We'll know at the end of October if CYDY has an abstract for the San Antonio Breast Cancer conference
   * IMO there is a chance the 1st safety review of the CRC trial commences in late Oct
   * Hearing of the Alzheimers's trial start will be satisfying
   * I can imagine that the protocol of the future TNBC trial will be strengthened by results of the 1st safety review of the CRC trial.
   * I think the pressure of news from multiple lines of HIV research is building up, but could be a few months away.
   * I'm very curious about studies in stroke

1o1ozwf,all,I graduated from Mason Dec 24 and still don't have a job. Looking for advice,"I graduated in Math in Dec 24. I only did Math because It was the fastest technical degree I could get. I figured with any technical degree and some personal projects and leetcode that would be enough. I did a statistical arbitrage project where I researched profitable momentum reversal strategies in cypto and a library that uses Spark to enable parallelization of some useful set of procedural operations.

That said I keep getting rejected from every job. I literally applied to 200 jobs and just got auto rejected.

Mason said I was missing prereqs for an MSCS, so I started it at Umass Amherst just to avoid a resume gap, so I'm currently doing that, although It's out of state and expensive and I'm not that motivated to do it. Luckily my classes are online this semester so I'm saving money but the coursework is rigorous, especially the algorithms for data science class I'm taking and I feel unmotivated. I'v been applying to internships as well and just keep getting rejected.  Besides that I'm currently working at Papa Johns and tutoring calculus and chess.

Anyways, I'm asking advice on what to do: should I give up on tech and become an actuary? I didn't want to do that as I didn't want to take exams for 5 years until fellowship. Should keep doing the MSCS? I feel a bit lost and a bit defeated.

1nzk8go,all,MindMed has shifted the way it presents itself to investors...,"Over the past several months, MindMed has shifted the way it presents itself to investors. Earlier iterations of the company’s investor materials included a familiar “team slide,” complete with management bios and track records. That slide has now been replaced with a more generic statement emphasizing an “experienced management team” with a “proven track record in developing and commercializing novel CNS therapies.”

This kind of shift is not unusual, and it’s not necessarily negative. It often reflects the natural evolution of a biotech company as it transitions from early development into late-stage clinical trials. In the early stages, when the science is still high-risk and unproven, credibility is often anchored in the team. Investors want to know who is steering the ship, and confidence in management becomes a proxy for confidence in the science.

By the time a program enters pivotal trials, however, the story changes. At that point, the company’s value proposition is less about the resumes of the executives and more about the clinical data, regulatory path, and commercial potential of the lead asset. A generic team statement shifts attention squarely onto the drug, in this case MM120, and allows the company to frame itself less as a management story and more as a late-stage therapeutic opportunity.

There is also a strategic dimension to this approach. Companies that are preparing for potential partnerships or buyouts often downplay individual leadership profiles in favor of a more institutional, asset-centric identity. Acquirers are primarily interested in the strength of the data package, the intellectual property position, and the market potential of the therapy. Emphasizing the drug over the team avoids tying the company’s identity too tightly to specific individuals who may or may not remain post-transaction.

We’ve seen similar shifts before. AveXis, in the run-up to its $8.7 billion acquisition by Novartis, gradually oriented its communications almost entirely around its gene therapy program for spinal muscular atrophy. Receptos followed a similar trajectory before being acquired by Celgene, with its S1P modulator ozanimod taking center stage. Arena Pharmaceuticals’ investor messaging leaned heavily into its late-stage pipeline assets in the months before Pfizer stepped in with a multibillion-dollar buyout. In each case, the team was still there doing the work, but the communications spotlight moved decisively to the pipeline.

MindMed’s updated messaging is consistent with a broader industry pattern. It’s not unique to them, ATAI and Compass Pathways have also shifted toward a more asset-focused narrative, while Cybin still places more emphasis on its team. The signal here is clear: the company is no longer selling itself primarily on management credentials or vision, but on the strength of a late-stage asset with defined commercial potential. That does not diminish the importance of leadership. In fact, it is precisely the strength of the team that enabled MindMed to reach this point.

1nzgk86,all,You’re Pitching AI Wrong. Here is the solution. (so simple an 18y old could do it),"I’ll keep it simple. I sell AI. It works. I make 6k a month (profit). Some of you make way more money than me and that’s fine. I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to the ones making $0, still stuck showing off their automation models instead of selling results.

Wake the fck up! Clients don’t care about GPT or Claude. They care about money in, money not wasted, time saved, and less risk. That’s it. When I stopped with the techie talk and sold outcomes, my close rate jumped a ton. Through the damn roof!

I used to explain parameters for 15 minutes. Shit...bad times...I'm sure you do it too. Client said, “Cool. How much money does it make me?” That’s when I learned. Pain first. Then more pain. And then enhance that pain even more. Like a real doctor pressing on your foot when it hurts. You wanna  solve it NOW! So then math gets second. And tech that nobody actually cares about goes last. (Magic)

Here’s how I sell now:

* I ask about the problem. What’s broken. What it costs. Who is stuck doing low value work. I listen.
* Then I do the math with them. In their numbers. Lost leads. Lost hours. Lost revenue. We agree on the cost.
* Then I pitch one clear outcome. “We pre-qualify leads. Your closers only talk to hot prospects.” I back it with proof. Then I talk price tied to ROI. If I miss, they don’t pay. Simple as that. Don't force anyone into a hard close. There is not point. Seriously. You are selling actual business oriented results. Not dating advice or how to lose weight. There is no point doing a discovery call of 40 mins long just to dig out the deeper pains of the prospect. It's about losing money in their business. Either they see it or they do not. 

Stop selling science projects. Clients with real money don’t want to be your test client. They want boring and proven. I chased shiny tools. Felt smart. Sold nothing. What sells is reliability. Clear wins. Case studies with numbers. aaaand proof of the system. “35 meetings in 30 days.” “120k in 6 months.” Lead with that. Tech later. Seriously... try also to not mention about tech at all. You will be amazed! Nobody cares <3. 

You’re not a tool seller. You’re an owner of outcomes. Clients already drown in software. And probalby their later software update will do most of what you are currently promising. They want results done for them. When I moved from one-off builds to retainers with clear targets, price pushback stopped. They pay because I own the number.

When they ask tech stuff, I keep it short: “We use a tested GPT setup on your data. Here’s the result you get.” Then back to ROI. If you drown them in jargon, you lose trust and the deal.

Your message should read like this: clear, bold, direct. Complexity doesn’t sell. Clarity sells.

Do this today:

* Audit your site, deck, and emails. Count AI words vs outcome words. If AI wins, you lose. Flip it.
* Fix your call flow. 70 percent on their problem. 20 percent on your plan tied to outcomes. 10 percent on objections. Most objections vanish when ROI is clear.

How I frame price: “Monthly is $2,000. Based on your numbers, expect 4 to 6x in month one. If we miss the goal, you don’t pay.” Clean. Confident. Manly. And YES... give them their money back if it does not work. ALL of them! And say you are sorry. Do it... don't take blood money. There is no reason about it.

Remember this. People don’t buy the hammer. They buy the house. AI is the hammer. The business result is the house. Sell the house.

Quick recap:

* Outcomes over tech.
* Proven over new toy.
* Owner of results over code monkey.

Do that and you’ll close more. Keep more. Make more. And yes, life gets easier.

See you on the next one.

1nza3am,all,Immigrants didn’t break Canada. Greedy policies and generational wealth hoarding did.,"Blaming immigrants for Canada’s housing and affordability crisis completely misses the real issue. This situation has been building for decades because of poor planning and bad policies, not because of people who legally came here to work, study, and build a life.

Boomers currently hold around 56 percent of Canada’s total wealth according to Statistics Canada, including most real estate and investment assets. Many own multiple homes or investment properties while younger generations face record housing prices and stagnant wages. Governments ignored the housing imbalance and speculative buying for years, and now the effects are catching up.

Immigration did not cause the housing crisis. It simply exposed long-standing problems faster. The real culprits are restrictive zoning, slow construction rates, and tax incentives that favored investors over first-time buyers. Between 2011 and 2021, Canada added only 1.8 housing units for every 100 new residents, one of the lowest rates in the G7 according to CMHC data.

Indian immigrants and other newcomers are among the most educated and employed groups in the country. Many work in essential industries such as healthcare, trades, technology, and logistics where there are serious labor shortages. Statistics Canada and Public Safety Canada both show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than Canadian-born citizens, and overall crime rates have continued to decline even as immigration levels increased.

People of Indian origin now make up about 1.9 to 2 million out of 41.6 million Canadians, roughly five percent of the population, yet contribute far above their share to the labor market, small business ownership, and tax revenue.

Many people are also unaware of how much their perception is influenced by online algorithms and political agendas. Negative news attracts more clicks, engagement, and advertising money, so algorithms repeatedly show the worst stories. Content creators and sensational media outlets make money from outrage, not balance. As a result, people end up believing that everything is falling apart when in reality many positive things happen every day, they just do not trend because positivity does not generate the same engagement.

Instead of believing everything seen online, it is better to look around and see things firsthand. The country’s problems are the result of policy failures and economic inequality, not individuals who followed the rules and are contributing to society. The issue is not the people coming here, it is the system that failed to plan for them.",HeatStrange6007,2025-10-06 10:25:22,615,0.95,145,760,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/canadaleft/comments/1nza3am/immigrants_didnt_break_canada_greedy_policies_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1nza3am/immigrants_didnt_break_canada_greedy_policies_and/,self.canadaleft,0,,,0,none,[],2576,85,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o2qer6,all,When Photos Become Weapons.The New AI Deepfake Threat Everyone’s Ignoring,"Guys, this is getting out of control and we need to talk about it. In the last few days I’ve seen a nasty new trend .people are taking ordinary photos from social media and using unregulated AI models to generate explicit deepfake videos.

It’s not just generic porn .some are asking the models to create JOI (Jerk-Off Instruction) style videos, where the fake actor appears to be instructing the viewer. Imagine someone in your college or workplace taking a single photo of you and turning it into a video of you “talking” and “directing” sexual acts. That’s not hypothetical .that’s happening.

The big AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) block this stuff, but plenty of models online don’t and with a VPN and a bit of know-how, people can access tools that produce disturbingly realistic results. If perpetrators want to, they can make convincing videos and distribute them privately or publicly.

This is digital sexual assault. It destroys reputations, terrorizes victims, and worst of all can be used against minors. We already struggle to hold abusers accountable now technology makes it easier for abusers to weaponize images.

Has anyone here dealt with this or seen it firsthand? What did you do and what do you think actually works to stop it?

1o1h7pg,all,Why Kraken Robotics is the best Anduril proxy on the market (DD),"Ok, this is my first long-form DD so take it easy on me lol

**TL;DR: Kraken Robotics is the primary public supplier for Anduril's underwater drone manufacturing ramp. Anduril just opened a facility designed to produce 200+ units per year. Each unit carries $2M-$10M of Kraken content. The stock has run but the revenue hasn't hit yet. Meanwhile, defense spending on autonomous systems is accelerating globally as underwater infrastructure becomes a critical national security concern. If you can wait 2-3 years, this setup feels very strong.**

**//**

**What Kraken actually does (and where they've screwed up before):**

Kraken Robotics ($KRKNF - US OTC // $PNG - Toronto Stock Exchange) started in c.2012 when CEO Karl Kenny decided traditional sonar companies were charging too much for garbage technology. His pitch (as far as I can see from a few old company videos) was simple: build synthetic aperture sonar that could image the ocean floor in high definition instead of the blurry mess everyone else was selling at the time.

For the first several years, Kraken was your typical struggling tech startup. They burned cash, missed revenue targets, and had to keep going back to the market for dilutive financing. In 2017 they did a massive rollback (reverse split) that defo pissed off early shareholders. The company was losing money consistently through 2020, and their stock traded under $0.20 CAD for years. I think it's fair to say that their mission remained viable (and potentially valuable), but obviously hardware is fucking TRENCHES and teething issues are almost inevitable.

But they kept improving the technology and eventually figured out the business model. Instead of just selling sonar systems, they vertically integrated: they built their own high-energy-density batteries (rated to 6,000m depth) and started manufacturing complete autonomous underwater vehicles like the Thunderfish and Catfish. This also gave them three revenue streams instead of one (as well as opening their business model up to **recurring revenue**, which of course is king).

**How they make money:**

About 75% of revenue comes from product sales: sonar systems, batteries, and complete underwater vehicles. The remaining 25% is services, where Kraken operates the equipment themselves for customers who need seafloor mapping or infrastructure inspection.

Their main customers are navies, defense contractors, and offshore energy companies. Gross margins are pretty strong (around 50% on products, up to 75% on services) because the barriers to entry are high. Obviously you can't exactly just spin up a synthetic aperture sonar business overnight lol.

The business went from $12M CAD revenue in 2020 to $91M in 2024, a 65% CAGR (this is objectively a very strong CAGR for any company). They finally turned profitable in 2022 and are now running 20%+ net margins. From what I can see, management is guiding for $100-130M CAD in 2025 (sources differ, but general consensus seems to be 9 figures CAD).

**The plan going forward**:

Kraken is building a 60,000 square foot battery manufacturing facility in Nova Scotia that will triple their current production capacity by late 2025. The timing and location (not far from Anduril's Rhode Island facility) is not a coincidence imo. They're gearing up to supply what could become hundreds of millions in annual orders.

**//**

**At the helm:**

Karl Kenny (Former Founder & CEO, Rest in Peace) spent decades in marine technology before starting Kraken. He worked at C-CORE (a marine research center) so it's fair to say he has world-class alpha in understanding the various customer pain points firsthand. This doesn't seem like some software guy pivoting into hardware. He knew sonar, he knew the defense procurement process, and he knew offshore energy. Watch any video of Karl eg:([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9eGwmRdPtg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9eGwmRdPtg)) and it's clear he is technical, articulate and doesn't deal in buzzwords or hype. He can also explain really complex underwater acoustics in plain English, which makes me (personally) quite bullish on his founder credibility / likability. Also, the fact that he stuck with the company through years of losses and dilution shows conviction.

He's also been smart about capital allocation. Rather than trying to do everything in-house, Kraken acquired PanGeo Subsea in 2020 to bolt on their services business. That acquisition has been accretive and gave them recurring revenue to smooth out the lumpiness of product sales.

Karl sadly passed in February this year, but it's fair to say the lion's share of the company's formation up until today was strongly informed by his leadership, hence why I bring him up at all.

I won't pretend to know anything super tangible or useful about the rest of the management team, but it seams appropriately lean and technical. New CEO Greg Reid has been with the company since 2018 and has defense industry experience. They don't seem to be overpaying themselves relative to the business size etc. Insider ownership is meaningful but not absurdly concentrated etc. Certainly no major red flags here (but by all means open to intel here from anyone better-researched).

**//**

**The Anduril Situation:**

For those of you who have been living under a rock and don't know who Anduril are, the tldr is essentially: Palmer Luckey (eccentric Hawaiian shirted VR genius who sold Oculus to Facebook for $2B at age 21) started a defense tech company that's now worth c.$30B private. They make autonomous weapons systems, sentry towers, interceptor missiles, and increasingly, **underwater drones**.

Palmer Luckey's underwater drone army runs on Kraken components. When Anduril decided to get into maritime autonomy, they acquired Dive Technologies in 2022. Dive was already using Kraken sonar and batteries in their autonomous subs. Post-acquisition, Anduril evaluated alternatives and decided to stick with Kraken. Not because they were lazy, but because the technology was genuinely the best available. Palmer has more than enough funding (and crucially, *reason*) to strip out a whole suite of components if there was a better alternative.

**The product lineup**:

Anduril's underwater systems all rely on Kraken:

1. **DiveLD**: 18-foot autonomous submarines capable of 10-day missions at depths up to 6,000m. Each unit carries approximately **$2M CAD worth of Kraken sonar and batteries**.
2. **Ghost Shark XL**: The big boy. An underwater truck that carries around **$10M CAD of Kraken technology** per unit.

(Anduril is also developing other underwater systems like **Copperhead** (a battery-powered torpedo drone) and **Seabed Sentry** (an underwater monitoring system). While it's reasonable to assume these could use Kraken batteries given the existing relationship, this hasn't been publicly confirmed.)

**The manufacturing ramp that (hopefully) changes everything:**

In 2024, Anduril opened a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. This factory is designed to produce **up to 200 DiveLD vehicles per year at full capacity**, plus Ghost Shark XLs and other products.

In 2024, Anduril opened a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. This factory is designed to produce **up to 200 DiveLD vehicles per year at full capacity**, plus Ghost Shark XLs and other products.

Let's do the math on just 50% utilization:

* 100 DiveLDs per year × $2M content per unit = **$200M CAD annual revenue**
* Add in even 20 Ghost Shark XLs × $10M content = another **$200M CAD**

That's $400M in potential annual revenue from Anduril alone, which is more than 4x Kraken's entire 2024 revenue of $91M.

**To be clear, these contracts are already signed:**

This isn't speculative. Australia awarded Anduril a **$1B USD contract** for dozens of Ghost Shark XL platforms over 5 years, including co-funding a second manufacturing facility. The US Navy selected Anduril's platforms for their Replicator program and has already taken delivery of units. Japan, South Korea, and the UK are evaluating deployments.

The Australian contract alone implies significant ongoing production. If even half these programs reach scale, Anduril could be manufacturing hundreds of UUVs annually by 2027-2028.

**Why Kraken should be locked in:**

A valid initial worry could be raised about customer concentration risk. What if Anduril switches suppliers? etc: I think that's very unlikely, for a few reasons. First, switching costs in defense are enormous. Once a technology is integrated and tested in prototypes, navies won't tolerate delays from component changes. Kraken's tech was chosen after competitive evaluations. Second, literally Anduril operates on a ""innovate or die"" philosophy. They stuck with Kraken because the performance is legitimately superior, not out of convenience. Thirdly, the US has hard 2027 goals for UUV deployment. IMO it would be wild to re-validate new suppliers this late, especially with no obviously superior supplier in sight.

**What if Anduril collapses tomorrow?**

To be clear, whilst I personally think this is an amazing Anduril proxy-stock - other revenue streams are growing too. To name a few:

**Huntington Ingalls** (one of the largest US shipbuilders) uses Kraken components in their Remus underwater vehicles through their Hydroid subsidiary.

**Offshore energy** continues to be a solid customer base. Oil and gas companies need pipeline inspection, and offshore wind is growing. Kraken's Thunderfish and services business serve this market.

**International navies** are buying directly. Kraken has contracts with the Canadian Navy, German Navy, and others for mine countermeasure systems.

**Deep sea mining** is an emerging opportunity. With critical minerals on the ocean floor and Trump signing executive orders to expedite offshore mining permits, demand for seafloor mapping could explode. Kraken often gets cited as the future 'Google Maps' of the ocean, for instance. I chose not to delve too deeply into this side of things as there are (currently) no clear, tangible revenue routes in the pipeline for this, so I am treating any quips of this line as a bit baseless / pumpy even. But deep sea mining is 100% a growing sector, and there is fair reason to believe that Kraken will find a way to get a slice of the (huge) pie.

Also - two bonus titbits here:

Their services business grew c.47% in 2024 and provides recurring revenue, what's not to love there.

CEO Greg Reid has publicly stated Kraken expects to land another XL UUV manufacturer contract this year beyond Anduril. Imo this would be one of the biggest bullish needle-movers for the stock, as they would prove beyond any doubt that this isn't a one-customer Anduril hard-carry.

**//**

**The Kraken Moat:**

Kraken is basically really really hard to compete with. The technology barriers are real / Developing cutting-edge synthetic aperture sonar and deep-sea batteries takes years of expertise / Kraken has a 10+ year head start etc

More importantly, they control the entire stack: sensors, power, and vehicles. Most competitors specialize in one piece. The only other companies offering complete packages are defense primes like Lockheed + Northrop Grumman. Kraken offers similar capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Also, **(and I am speculating here, to be clear)** for any future company (like Anduril) that prides itself on moving fast and iterating quickly, working with a nimble supplier that can adapt and customize etc beats dealing with the bureaucracy and long lead times of traditional defense giants.

**Potential Catalysts**:

1. **NASDAQ uplisting**: The company trades on Toronto Venture Exchange and OTC in the US. A NASDAQ uplisting would unlock institutional buying and dramatically increase liquidity (it kinda sucks right now..). They'd need a sustained price around $4 USD for 90 days. Currently trading around $4.45 USD as of today, October 8th.
2. **Anduril production milestones**: Any announcement about facility ramp-up, delivery schedules, or new contracts will move the stock. We saw this in September 2024 when the Australian Ghost Shark contract drove shares up 17% in one day.
3. **The second XL UUV customer**: Management has telegraphed this is coming in 2025. It would validate that multiple defense primes are standardizing on Kraken technology.
4. **Anduril IPO hype**: Anduril is probably the most anticipated private company IPO (I will be buying the shit out of it personally). As it enters mainstream discourse, investors will discover Kraken as the only public proxy play.

**//**

**Why this won't 100x:**

I despise pumpers as much as the rest of you so let's be sane about this

**To be clear, this is not a wildcard lottery play where you will 100x your money.**

I've thought long and hard about roughly where we are. Kraken stock is up roughly 150% since the start of this year. The market has obviously figured out the Anduril connection. This isn't a secret stock - the market cap is over a billion dollars.

But here's the thing: the actual revenue from Anduril's manufacturing ramp hasn't shown up in the numbers yet. We're still in the anticipation phase. The Rhode Island facility just opened. The Australian contract just got signed. The production scale-up is happening in 2025-2027.

For what it's worth, I've been in multiple situations like this. I bought Rocket Lab at $10 after it had more than doubled in a few months from $4. Obviously never feels great buying at the top. I'm still holding today (where it sits at $65) and clearly that was a strong play. Same with ASTS at $18 after it had quite literally tripled. Basically I'm just trying to get inb4 'bUt iT rOsE sO mUcH'. My point being, if you are only looking for flat line graphs, I can guarantee most of those will continue plateauing anyway or you would ironically not want to put money into the stock to begin with.

tldr: this stock has gone up. I think it will go up a lot more when the revenue materializes / catalysts hit.

**The valuation isn't crazy:**

Kraken trades at a trailing PE of about 85. Compare that to other mid-cap drone stocks: AVAV trades at 152 PE, Kratos at 451 PE. Imo the market is giving Kraken less credit despite arguably better growth prospects. Let's not forget that Kraken is growing at 65% CAGR with 20%+ net margins (and ostensibly another XL UUV manufacturer contract in the pipeline, this year)

**//**

**What could go wrong?**

To me, the biggest risk by far is execution. Can they actually scale production fast enough? The new battery facility needs to come online smoothly. Any delays will hurt the stock for sure.

Second risk is lumpy defense revenue. Government contracts can shift quarters unexpectedly, creating volatility. If you're going to own this, I think you need to stomach drawdowns as and when they happen - especially given the stock has ran a fair bit this year.

General recession is also a risk, though at this point most of our positions would be screwed lol. If the broader market craters, small cap Canadian tech will get hit hard regardless of fundamentals. (That said, defense spending tends to be relatively counter-cyclical and the current underwater drone buildout is driven by genuine national security, rather than 'tech trends').

I could also be wrong about the Anduril revenue scale. Maybe they ramp slower than expected. Maybe gross margins compress as they scale. Maybe the contracts get cut. These are unavoidable for any company relying on fewer, larger contracts to fuel their growth. It's basically the buy-in to having the equal opposite at any time (eg: a massive orgasmic DOD contract)

**My take on the next 2-3 years:**

If Anduril executes even close to plan, Kraken should be doing $300-500M revenue by 2027. At 25% EBITDA margins (conservative given current margins), that's $75-125M EBITDA. Apply a 25-35x multiple and you get to $10-20 CAD per share by 2027, depending on assumptions.

Current price is around $4.45. That's 2-5x upside over the next 2 years or so if things go right. Not life-changing money overnight, but imo excellent risk-reward for a company with real technology, real contracts, and a clear path to scale.

**//**

**It's a bitch to buy (but I maintain that this is a good thing):**

Kraken is not on Robinhood afaik, so you'll need a broker that handles international stocks or OTC markets. Interactive Brokers, Schwab, and Fidelity all support it I think - and for the Brits you can buy on Trading212 (in ISA too!).

Liquidity is a bit ass at market open but it's not a liquid large cap either. I would not advise market ordering this thing. Use limits lol.

I actually like the fact it isn't on the largest retail trading broker yet - an uplisting / feature on robinhood would almost certainly boost the stock and open it up to more institutional investment

**//**

**Positions or ban!**

1o0sxig,all,"Enter, if you dare, the DeVos era!","I have not penned a post (only comments) in some time. With the transition of CEO leadership from Sumit to Glen, I thought this would be a good time to reflect on the past and wonder about the future. 

As I have mentioned before, my first investment in Microvision was around 2001. Rick Rutkowski was CEO at that time. I think he was Microvision’s first CEO, if so, his run was approximately 12 years. Then came a 10+ year run for Alex Tokman, a short 2+ year stint by Perry Mulligan and then Sumit’s 5+ year tenure. 

From one perspective, you might say all of the CEOs did an admirable job. That is, they kept the company alive. No small feat for a company with almost zero revenue over the years. Here we sit, 32 years after the founding of Microvision and the company still exists. Yes, that existence is/was largely supported on the backs of investors buying new shares as they were made available. But life is fleeting and Microvision is still kicking! 

From another point of view, each CEO can be seen as failing. Obviously, each one either resigned or was replaced. The promise of the Microvision technology was not realized by any CEO. Will Glen carry us to the promised land? 

#**Microvision Historical Events**

Here are some Microvision highlights over the years. Note: This list is not meant to be an exhaustive accounting of all pertinent events.

- Early years – Military applications
- Early 2000s thru 2015 – Pico Projection 
- 2002 – Nomad – Red only HUD positioned for industrial/automotive repair technicians
- 2004 – Lumera spin off
- 2007 – Flic – Bar code scanner
- 2007 – HUD and other displays for automotive
- 2009 – SHOWWX projector
- 2010 – Intel gaming application
- 2010 – Purchase of Motorola patent portfolio
- 2010 – Pioneer automotive HUD
- 2010 – Corning kills development of synthetic green laser
- 2014 – Sharp – PicoP display
- 2014 – UPS – package guidance
- 2014 – Sony pico projection for smart phone
- 2015 – Sharp – RoboHon phone
- 2016 – STMicro – partnership
- 2017 – Microsoft – Hololens 2
- 2018 – First mention of LiDAR publicly
- 2018 – Sharp – 5 year display only agreement
- 2020 – Amazon – consumer LiDAR smart speaker deal falls through
- 2020 – Microvision transitions to an automotive LiDAR company
- 2023 – Microvision acquires assets of Ibeo


The stark and evident truth, as can be seen by this list, is that Sumit did not close a single commercial agreement during his tenure. He did close the acquisition of the Ibeo assets, which remains to be seen how valuable that will be. Although, considering the Tri-LiDAR approach, it seems to be quite valuable. 

#**The Glen DeVos Era**

Enter the Sandman, er, uh, I mean Glen!

I believe Glen was brought in to support the automotive LiDAR initiative and as a backup plan to replace Sumit as CEO if he could not execute this year. As we know, the Glen rip cord was pulled, perhaps earlier than expected. My Occam’s Razor view is that Sumit did not have any near-term deals in the works and therefore the BoD decided it was time to make the CEO change. Surely, Sumit’s messaging to the BoD was the same as his messaging to the public. It really could not be any different. I believe the BoD was as worn out as we were. 

#**Let’s review the various potential Microvision markets** 

#**Industrial LiDAR**
This market was supposed to be a bridge to the more lucrative automotive market. While no absolute dates were committed to by Microvision management, they alluded to industrial deals closing as early as the summer of 2024. Here we are, more than 12 months hence and we have diddly squat. Glen really does need to provide his view as to where the industrial deals stand. In my opinion this is the most important area that needs an update. 

Anubhav first mentioned the $30m to $50m of industrial demand over the next 12 to 18 months in March. While this was not formal guidance, those numbers were presumably a real belief and could be translated into real revenue. If you take the midpoint of those numbers, that would be $40m of demand in 16 months’ time. Since Anubhav made that statement, there are now 9 months remaining and we are still at zero $$$. Are we going to get $40m of industrial agreements in the next 9 months (perhaps not revenue but backlog)? If not, perhaps Glen needs to reset those expectations. A new CEO only gets one honeymoon period, if there is bad news to be delivered it’s best to do it early and all at one time. The kitchen sink philosophy. If he does not reset the projections and timelines, he owns them. It’s as simple as that.  



#**Automotive LiDAR**

Ever since Sumit pulled the plug on any near-term deals for mass market automotive LiDAR on the Q2 2024 conference call, I have not had much hope for near or mid-term deals in this space. That was a tough call, but I appreciate Sumit ripping off the band-aid. BTW – I give Sumit credit for communicating the situation in the automotive market. In my opinion, none of the other LiDAR CEOs really came clean with their investors in the way Sumit did. 

However, Glen seems to have given a bit of new life into this vertical by way of some of his public comments. He seems to have portrayed that a deal could be inked sometime in the first half of 2026. I am not sure how that is possible though. Sumit told us that the OEMs are reluctant to sign a Series Production agreement with Microvision due to the fact that Microvision does not have a sustainable business. Clearly, that has not changed. Does Glen have the cache and cahoots to circumnavigate this issue with the OEMs? I kind of doubt it. Did the OEMs relax some of their previous dogma surrounding their procurement rules. Also, doubtful. Perhaps Glen will address this seeming conundrum on the Q3 call. 

Microvision formally introduced the Tri-LiDAR approach at IAA in early September. Seemingly, this is a Glen idea. The core of this approach is a low-cost solution that combines 3 purpose-built LiDAR sensors to solve both urban and highway driving for L2, L2+, and L3 ADAS requirements. My questions revolve around sensor fusion. Will the Microvision Tri-LiDAR solution come pre-built with sensor fusion for the 2 MOVIA and 1 MAVIN sensor? (EDIT: In Glen's pitch and interview at IAA, he said sensor fusion would be the responsibilty of the OEM. He implied that Microvision's 3 LiDAR sensors would only be providing a standard pointcloud.) Is other sensor fusion for cameras and radar required? If so, is that the responsibility of the OEM?  Furthermore, is the concept of the MAVIN DVL completely cooked?  Is the MAVIN DVL bespoke pointcloud a deal breaker for all OEMs? Can the OEM hurdle of wanting to own their own perception layer be overcome somehow? 

This also touches on the subject that was highlighted in the recent R.J. Scaringe (CEO of Rivian) interview. He articulated a change in how the OEMs are approaching the problem. Previously, they were basing their solutions on a rule-based architecture. 

Sumit had commented on this over the years. That is, Sumit said the OEMs want a predictable solution whereby the system can be validated. In other words, a deterministic solution where the same input always creates the same result.  

Scaringe said that the new approach is an AI based approach whereby there is early fusion. Early fusion means that a real-world model is created (think of it as a very rich pointcloud) by using all sensor modalities (camera, radar, LiDAR) and then it is used to train the model which creates continuous improvement. 

The opposite of early fusion is late fusion whereby a real-world model, complete with objects, is derived and created by each modality of sensor and then some type of perception software attempts to make sense of it all. Having to deal with possible different results from each modality. At the RID meeting Glen was asked about what type of fusion Microvision was working on and he definitively said “early fusion”. 

From my point of view, the type of solution that Scaringe is describing is not deterministic. That is, given the same exact inputs, the output results can differ as the model continues to learn. Curiously, Microvision first began using the phrase “deterministic AI at the edge” in their 2024 annual report filed on March 26th, 2025. I understand what “at the edge” means, but I am curious as to what “deterministic AI” means. Perhaps Glen can clarify this for his investors. 

It does seem like Microvision has a market advantage by owning both a short-range and long-range LiDAR sensors. 

Luminar, Aeva, and Aeye only have long range LiDAR sensors. Since they are all using the 1550nm wavelength, it will be difficult for them to create a short range sensor that can meet price constraints. 

Innoviz is developing a short-range sensor, but they only started that recently and presumably it will take some time. Also, it is not clear as to the cost of the Innoviz LiDAR sensors. They never seem to talk about the cost/price of their sensors. We know there is a mechanical component to the InnovizTwo sensor, which tends to add manufacturing cost. 

I have not heard anything about Valeo having a short-range sensor. Cepton (now Koito) has both long-range and short-range sensors, but since they are no longer a stand-alone LiDAR company, we don’t hear much about them anymore. 

The Chinese vendors have both short- and long-range sensors, but will the western OEMs commit to a Chinese vendor as part of their supply chain? Doubtful. 

Therefore, the problem boils down to whether or not the Tri-LiDAR architecture is supported by the OEMs. If it is, then perhaps Microvision will have a strong leg up on the competition. We should all be on the lookout for evidence that this architecture is supported by the OEMs. Again, perhaps Glen can provide additional detail on this matter on the Q3 call. 



#**Defense**
Sumit communicated that this vertical was in the early innings. They still do not have this vertical articulated on their website. Take that for what it is worth. Sumit also promised a drone swarm demonstration in the 1st half of 2026. However, that was a promise from a CEO who may have known that he was walking on thin ice. It will be interesting to see if Glen reconfirms that plan. 
 
It is clear that currently there is a lot of money being poured into the defense space. It is not clear to me that Microvision has any advantage with their LiDAR technology in this space, especially for drones. It seems to me a drone would be better served by a 360-degree LiDAR and perhaps a LiDAR with longer range. It doesn’t seem to me a low-cost LiDAR is all that advantageous. I mean it is the military and they are used to spending money! 😉 Perhaps weight, size, and power are key parameters, but I am not clear if Microvision has an advantage in these areas anymore. 

Sumit also alluded to Microvision’s automotive LiDAR being used to support vehicle autonomy in military vehicles. This makes sense to me. But we need more information/details about the use cases here. 

I am not sure about the IVAS/SBMC initiative. Yes, the Microvision IP is part of Hololens 2. It is highly likely that same IP is part of the IVAS 1.2. Will the same IP be used as one of the display engines for the new SBMC initiative? Dunno. I would say there a decent chance that it will be. But even if so, what would that translate to in terms of revenue? Dunno. 

At some point, Microvision needs to communicate more details on their overall defense strategy. What attributes of their technology give them an advantage? What specific areas within the defense realm are relevant to enable optimization and monetization of these advantages? Maybe it is still too early to articulate this to the public. But inquiring minds want to know. And the clock is ticking. There is not an infinite amount of time available. Again, Glen needs to update us here, at least to some degree.  

#**AR/Glasses/Display** 

The AR glasses space seems to be heating up. u/baverch recently dedicated an entire episode of his podcast to this vertical. The big boys are pouring investment into this area. Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple (recently), along with a number of smaller companies, are all working on consumer AR glasses. Sumit had repeatedly said that Microvision stands ready to support any initiatives in this area. At the same time, he seemed to portray that actual revenue from this space is still relatively far away. As we know, a senior Meta executive recently stated that the best end-game architecture is a laser beam scanning (LBS) approach. But the timeline for that approach was beyond some of the more near-term architectures. Why? I don’t know. Maybe there are still some hurdles with miniaturization, cost, or other parameters for an LBS based display in glasses.  

With regard to the NED heads up displays, like Hololens, it seems to me that space has gone lukewarm. Microsoft has given up on a consumer version of Hololens. Magic Leap seems to be dead. The Apple Vision Pro seems to be a flop. This particular type of solution may be tied to the defense vertical. At any rate, perhaps the AR glasses are closer to becoming a reality and therefore the NED HUD concept dies on the vine. I don’t think so, as I think the difference in performance of consumer AR glasses and a military NED HUD will be vast for a long time. 

#**Summary**

In the spirit of “a rising tide lifts all boats”, in my opinion, there are 2 macro trends and 1 potential product revisit that can buoy the Microvision stock (I mean over and above winning deals), and via the commutative property the Microvision business (think capital, equity, and less dilution). Remember, the market is forward looking. Therefore, the future, if it is believed, can support a stock price today – even if the future is still relatively far away. 

- Physical AI (recently highlighted by Jensen Huang) – Both the industrial and automotive verticals fall into this category, but there is so much more. Robotics for example and presumably many other needs that people have not even thought of yet. If LiDAR is a core sensor for the Physical AI world, that bodes well for Microvision. It does not guarantee anything, as Microvision needs to be equal to or better than the competition for a given use case – which is currently unproven. But it does provide a potential macro lift for the Microvision business prospects. 

- AR glasses – This vertical seems to be gaining strength over the past 6 to 12 months. It still seems like it might be some time before Microvision would enjoy any revenue here. But again, the market is forward-looking. If there is a thought that Microvision’s technology can fulfill an ultimate need, then the current stock price can be affected positively. At this point Sumit has downplayed this market greatly – most likely because it is the truth. But again, maybe things are changing. 


- Pico Projection and Interactive Display - Like many here, the prospects of Pico Projection was one of the big reasons I invested in the company in the first place and continued to invest over the years. In my opinion, having a projector in a cell phone would be a key differentiator for a mobile phone manufacturer. Perhaps the technological challenges are just too great to make it work. Maybe it requires too much power, generates too much heat, is too bulky, and costs too much money for it to be feasible. I suppose this is the reality. But it seems like these tech challenges are nullified for a smart speaker. Why isn’t someone building an interactive projector for a smart speaker like Amazon tried to do 5 years ago?  A true mystery. At the same time, Microvision is clearly capital constrained. They cannot invest in all the things they may want to. Perhaps the Pico Projection and Interactive Display verticals need to remain on the back burner until a sustainable business can be created.  

Like everyone, I will be very interested to see and hear what Glen has to say on the Q3 update call. Typically, a new CEO aims to create conditions for their own success. This sometimes means setting the bar low, which may include getting all the bad news out now. 

From an interview Glen did at IAA, he was quoted as saying the following, ""That market (referring to Industrial ADAS) is here and now. We've been working with a couple customers on what I would call pre-development contracts to validate our system ... we expect those products to be sold very quickly.""  In my opinion the elephant in the room is the status of the industrial deals. Hopefully, Glen can both clarify and expound upon this statement and the status of any/all industrial deals.",mvis_thma,2025-10-08 03:39:58,149,0.95,92,241,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/MVIS/comments/1o0sxig/enter_if_you_dare_the_devos_era/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/1o0sxig/enter_if_you_dare_the_devos_era/,self.MVIS,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],16668,34,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o4u1y3,all,"The Best ""How Do I Pick My Degree"" Advice I Ever Received.","When I was in high school, I spent a summer interning in a wood and materials science lab at my local land grant university. During my time there, I met a post-doctoral student who had obtained a bachelor's degree, a master's, a Ph.D, and was working beyond that...the degrees he obtained were obscure, he worked at the nexus of wood science, chemistry, materials science, and composites. But he loved his work and was well respected.

He gave me quite possibly the most unique and excellent degree and college picking advice I'd ever heard, and it impacted my decision to pursue Environmental Economics and Policy a few years later. I never switched degrees while in college, and now work in a job germane to my major that I love.

His advice? Don't get attached to a degree's name or look at what friends and relatives have chosen as degree paths. Embrace college as your moment to become a unique individual.

Instead, go online and open the ""course catalog"" for the university (or universities) you hope to attend, and in another window, open up a spreadsheet. If you don't know what a course catalog is, it's a list of all of the classes a student is required to take at the university to obtain various degrees, and usually includes information about what each of the classes entail.

First, select every major you may even remotely be interested in. Don't just look at ""realistic careers"" or ""what makes a lot of money."" Consider everything you may be interested in, even if it was an interest as a child you had in fisheries or astronomy.

Second, using the court catalog, add to the spreadsheet all of the class requirements for every degree you may be even remotely interested in.

Once you have all of that information in a table, identify all of the classes you think you're interested in, and identify all of the classes that you think you wouldn't like. Pick the degree with the most classes you like and the fewest you dislike. 

That way, you will enjoy your classes in college, even if they're difficult, which will result in less stress and probably better grades. Additionally, your professors will be able to see that you are motivated in or enjoy your classes, allowing you to stand out.

This is extremely useful for many reasons. Professors can recommend you for internships, jobs, events, and professional societies, or write recommendation letters for you if you seek to attend grad school. But most importantly, you will actually like what you're doing day-to-day, and you'll be able to claim your own identity in the work you chose to pursue, instead of feeling like you're being churned through a system.

Finding all of the classes and adding them to a spreadsheet may take a few hours, but given that the degree you get will impact the job you have for the rest of your life, it's an extremely worthwhile investment of your time.

**P.S.** Remember, we're all going to be in the workforce in 40 years, and nobody knows how technology and social trends will change the relative wages and employment of any career field. You will never have permanent stability based on the information available the year you entered college. The greatest stability you can have is love of your work and greater expertise than others in your field because you love what you do",AdvancedInstruction,2025-10-12 22:18:00,140,0.95,19,159,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/CollegeMajors/comments/1o4u1y3/the_best_how_do_i_pick_my_degree_advice_i_ever/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/1o4u1y3/the_best_how_do_i_pick_my_degree_advice_i_ever/,self.CollegeMajors,0,Advice,,0,none,[],3287,58,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

To summarize:

>[**Arrive AI**](https://www.arriveai.com/) is a **start-up** specialized in **autonomous deliveries using patented smart mailboxes (Arrive Points™)**.

**Current price:** around **$3.90**.

I would like to introduce this DD with this [**1-minute video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycWOyUUdRSU), published on **September 12, 2024**, as I think it **shows relatively well what they are doing**.

# Let's start with the sauce: Amazon and their patents

I started following this company's activities a couple of months ago, but this past weekend I took a closer look at their [**latest investor presentation**](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67c5de33fe42ad3c82b5dbd6/68d18175f2665e77c3aa638b_Arrive_Ai_Investor_Deck.pdf), and on **slide 13,** where they talk about their **patents**, I found a very interesting **reference to Amazon**: “**beat Amazon by four days**”.

https://preview.redd.it/9tuq6fh1ogtf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5885ed668ba89e5387e3b5c404f0c4acb419711e

This caught my attention, so I went to their [**latest ER call transcript**](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-arrive-ai-q2-2025-sees-extended-market-decline-93CH-4194202), where I saw the context I needed to understand what they were referring to: it turns out that **they won the patents for the smart package receiving devices that both Amazon and the US Postal Service wanted** so badly at the time.

https://preview.redd.it/d6uu7n53ogtf1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0773f602ffaf90210ada03c6322adc8b20cb82

By the way, the **5-year strategic plan** mentioned at the end of the previous image can be found on **slide 11** of the **previous** [**investor presentation**](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67c5de33fe42ad3c82b5dbd6/68d18175f2665e77c3aa638b_Arrive_Ai_Investor_Deck.pdf), and I recommend taking a look at it because it details very well the path they want to follow: it will not be easy, and they will need a lot of money to achieve their goals.

During the ER call, **John Richardson**, **Chief Legal Officer of $ARAI**, continued to clarify **how they would defend their patents in light of Amazon's alleged interest**, to which he replied...

>**We don't see any concern** \[...\] **whether it's Amazon or anyone else, we hope to reach a partnership with them or license them to use our system and move forward**.

Later in the call, **one of the company's early investors** (Keith) **asked Dan O'Toole** (CEO) **how the sale of the patent** (to Amazon, I understand) **would affect her shares**, and well, I think **the answer will leave you speechless...**

>My running mantra to myself is **in the next few years either we're going to be owned by the biggest company in the world or we're going to be the biggest company in the world**.

Of course, this is just the **CEO's opinion**, he makes that quite clear.

To conclude this section, **when asked whether they had already spoken to companies such as Amazon or pharmaceutical chains** about transporting medicine packages, **the CEO stated** something that could be a very **interesting catalyst** if they announce some kind of partnership with a giant in the future...

>**There are companies we have spoken to that you know about, and others that you don't know about yet**.

# The case of Bitcoin and their cryptocurrency

On **September 30, 2025**, Mr. Dan O'Toole dropped several gems during the [**interview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_5F8qBt1U) at Nasdaq (based on its content, I gather that the interview took place during the week of **September 15, 2025**), which I will try to summarize.

>\[...\] Just **got a picture with Michael Sailor** here in New York this week.

This was already announced in a [**press release**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/computers-technology-and-internet/arrive-ai-embraces-cryptocurrency-for-everything-1064745) on **August 25, 2025**, and I **find it very interesting** that they want to adopt a payment system using Bitcoin and their own cryptocurrency because, according to [**Finviz**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARAI&p=d), the stock only has a **float of 3.45 million**.

https://preview.redd.it/nocyhe0logtf1.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0267de6633d69885962111099a0fa74e332cd86

By this, I basically mean that in the **hypothetical case** that they finally adopt cryptocurrencies as a means of collection and payment, a PR about that could greatly increase the price.

And, indeed, here is that [**photograph**](https://x.com/arrive_ai/status/1967982858955313340), which was taken with him **between September 8 and 10**, when the **27th Annual H.C. Wainwright Global Investment Conference** was held (at **17:05** in this [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuAXnxSWvWk), the CEO himself **mentions that Michael Saylor is at the conference**).

https://preview.redd.it/0uzr43jmogtf1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=01c6fa942c3232c060750d723659615d40c76ae2

I don't think this photograph means there's anything more behind it, but **it's curious, to say the least**.

**01:38** → this is where he mentions that **they want to adopt “Arrive coin”**, which **they are not yet ready** to do, although they believe it will be **“a big driver”** for the company.

>The arrive coin \[...\] **we're not ready to really get into that just yet**. We do see tokenization in **crypto as a part of our future**. I want to get everything out there as quick as I can.

>\[...\] Stay tuned because that's going to be exciting. We think that's going to be a **big driver** of our company.

**02:22** → here he specifies that he believes their **patent portfolio is quite strong** and that they announced a **$10 million share buyback program**.

>**I'm highly bullish on my company,** \[...\] we have a **first position patent portfolio**, very strong, we feel like **our intrinsic value is very strong** **and at the levels that our stock is trading at right now we want to buy our own shares,** so we did announce up to **$10 million share buyback between now and the end of Q1 of 2026.**

I have [**verified**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/computers-technology-and-internet/arrive-ai-announces-10-million-share-repurchase-program-1069895) this, and it is correct: they announced the share buyback program on **September 8, 2025**, and plan to repurchase shares worth **up to $10 million until March 31, 2026**.

https://preview.redd.it/v8mmdqfrogtf1.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d17235f3b1c19c10e72b8fe73ba8c20edaff03

**03:01** → here he mentions two important things: first, that **the company has no revenue**, and second, that with the **five-year plan** I mentioned earlier in the DD, they **could multiply the company's valuation by 10.**

>\[...\] In the **absence of revenue**, which we're low to no revenue right now, **milestones** are what we're focused on.

>\[...\] Our **five-year plan** concentrates on us having a **100,000 units** out in five years, **10xing the valuation of the company,** and just really **starting to deploy today**.

**03:45** → he mentions that Arrive AI is **like the Tesla network of autonomous delivery**.

>The idea of having multiple boxes for delivery and shipping in front of a home or business is a **non-starter**.

>You need to have **one platform** that's arrive AI, that can work with everyone: we've got all the [**intellectual property and patents**](https://www.arriveai.com/intellectual-property) around that, and **we feel like we are going to be the Tesla network of autonomous delivery**.

**05:46** → once again, he is **promoting his company as if it were the next big thing.**

>\[...\] **If you looked at Amazon and missed out, if you looked at Nvidia and missed out**, anything that you've ever looked at and you kicked yourself, **we are right here in front of you right now, don't miss us**.

>We are at the **intersection of autonomy and AI**, two of the biggest drivers in the market today, and when you invest in Arrive AI, you get both.

>You know, **we're going to change the delivery world forever and it'll never be the same**.

# More data

I will first include the current **chart** so that you can refer to it when analyzing this last section.

https://preview.redd.it/1znbetlwogtf1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca46e80453da20d5c5751f760472409364d4ec22

**I'll start with the bad news**, because there's one thing that doesn't add up for me: they just announced a **share buyback program**, but [**three executives sold**](https://www.insiderdashboard.com/search?tab=insider-trading-trend&page=1&query=ARAI) **almost $8 million worth of shares on June 10, 2025**, all at **$13.85**.

https://preview.redd.it/vz81r28zogtf1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d389627fd04173df04230f6f511bb9d73260b6b

That said, **June 10** is the day I have marked with a **yellow arrow on the chart**, and there was a **150% increase in price** due to this [**news**](https://finviz.com/news/77244/arrive-ai-secures-another-key-patent-for-its-smart-mailbox-anchored-autonomous-last-mile-delivery-solutions-platform), related to another of their patents.

https://preview.redd.it/fjfsc718pgtf1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26f858a7d28eb02720e064feb424aa9b0564edd

I would like to think that this **chain of events** is simply due to what any investor would do, **sell high and buy low**, but the truth is that **we cannot confirm this**, and the fact is that [**Finviz**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARAI&p=d) currently shows **insider ownership** of **almost 90%**.

What we can deduce from the chart is a **change in trend**, with an **upturn beginning on September 22**, 2025, just as it hit $3, a couple of weeks after the share repurchase program was announced.

I would say that this **momentum** has been partly created by all the [**eyes**](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=25375756) that have recently been watching the company due to **advertisements** on the **internet** and **social media**.

https://preview.redd.it/al2u9digvgtf1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=657c92113c9a15bdb7763db9ccaeb9279599b284

In addition, the executive order on “[**Unleashing American Drone Dominance**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/unleashing-american-drone-dominance/)” announced by Trump on June 6, 2025, will help the development of all types of drones, so **$ARAI's activity should also benefit**: the company mentions this both in the [**Wainwright conference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuAXnxSWvWk) I mentioned earlier (**minute 19:25**) and in this [**section**](https://www.arriveai.com/blog/america-just-opened-the-skies-were-ready?ref=cybernewscentre.com) of its website.

In fact, in the Chinese tech city of **Shenzhen**, a company called **Meituan** has been making **deliveries via drones since at least** [**2023**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l-8NcbfJEs), and on **June 6, 2025**, they [**announced**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UKsH90nlI) that they were going to **expand their operations to Dubai**, so it's not something so futuristic that it's years away; it's practically already here, and **I don't think the US wants to fall behind** technologically speaking in something as simple as delivering goods with drones.

https://preview.redd.it/s0hawrmxwgtf1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=916dd2487d927421d8c55bb11e161e3904e1de07

Here is a [**more recent video**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZzAD7r4wan8), from just a month ago, showing **how the drone delivery system works in Shenzhen**.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that, according to [**Holdings Channel**](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=arai), there are 14 funds with a position, with relatively interesting names and “conservative” positions.

# My conclusions

In my opinion, **Amazon** and the **US Postal Service** will end up showing some kind of interest sooner or later, so it could be the next big thing, as the CEO mentions.

On the subject of **cryptocurrencies**... keep in mind that not all companies that adopt them skyrocket when they publish the PR, so it's **more of a gamble**, although I find it appealing that they want to use new technologies and integrate them into their business model.

They'll need money, so **I expect some dilution along the way**.

Could easily go back to $3 in the short term; **it all depends on how they play their cards**.

*Zedal / Karnak / Daya - Under the Mask*

""Huff...puff...""

""Halfway there!""

Zedal swung away against the motion sensors while facing the screen. Alan had brought home a new game featuring a human sport known as ""boxing"". It was confusing at first because the combat arena was called a ring instead of a box despite being square.

""GRAAAH!"" With another strong upswing, he knocked his opponent out. Alan cheered from beside him.

""You're really getting the hang of this! Before, you kept missing.""

""Heh...because Uvei always relied on claw slashes. We expect a good few more inches in our unarmed attacks.""  
In fact, Zedal had to wear specialized gloves just to avoid cutting himself with said claws. Curling your fingers to add mass to your strikes with ""fists"" was another human novelty...

He swapped places with Alan on the couch and glanced over to the dining table where the women were sitting.

It had been 3 days since the Rizal experienced the ""Uven Catharsis"" phenomenon in the commercial vessel. It was fortunate that Natalie was there to support her through the experience. He could only imagine how poorly his own episode would have gone if Alan wasn't there for him.

Apparently, Natalie's protective behavior was because she was worried about the unwanted attention Rizal would get as a result of this and how it might disrupt her new life. In a sense, she got her wish...

\[-**GET. LOST!**\]

""Noooo....!""

...Because the star of the now-trending internet clips was the human woman herself, snapping at the camera. The brunette had her face buried in her hands as yet another angle of the incident played from a phone on the table.

While it didn't really surprise any Uvei that had met a human themselves, this display of aggression from a human was certainly a shock to most other species in the Coalition.  
With this the Terrans' little secret might have finally gotten out, for better or for worse.

It might have cost them some easy trading opportunities, but from what he's seen of online discourse, most human sentiment was in support of what she did.

""Fufufu..."" Rizal tossed a few cookies into her mouth and gulped down some tea before leaning in to speak warmly. Her tail lightly rested against her back in an act of comfort.

Ever since her breakthrough, the elder Uven had become much more relaxed and even affectionate.  
""I thought you looked very cool, Natalie\~""

""Please stop...""

For someone who was usually so subdued, having the one time she lost her cool repeatedly broadcast to the universe must be mortifying.

""Oh my...your ears are turning red.""

Zedal chimed in merrily at this. ""Oh, I heard about this one! When a human is exceptionally embarrassed or angry, they do something called 'blushing' where their facial features can turn red. ""

""Fascinating...""

""S-SHUT UP!""

___

Karnak Kepal growled with irritation as he scurried down his fortress's staircase. He stood at over 2.5 meters tall and boasted bulkier body notably more muscular than the average Uven foot soldier.

The Uven in ornate armor nearly knocked the entire door down as he arrived at his destination in an underground laboratory.

Immediately, his snout turned towards a crate with English words and the symbol for a Terran disaster relief organization. A small number of Uvei were in the room and stood at attention when he arrived.

""Is this it, Jokan?"" Karnak impatiently stomped his way to the box to inspect its contents. One of the nearby Uven saluted as he gave his response.

""Yes, Chief! We brought this 'food aid' into the lab just 1 hour ago! The flash-burner has just been assembled as well.""

""Then what are you wasting time for? Do it.""

At his command, the soldier pulled out a cube from the box. He unraveled the packaging to reveal a clump of red cultivated meat inside, still frozen due to the special packaging. He tossed unto a metal plate of a machine beside him.  
With the pull of a lever, a metal lid descended and an intense fire flared up, cooking the lump in a matter of moments.

Another growl escaped Karnak's throat. Those conceited, impudent *Tuktaks*! Who asked the Terrans for this?!

Once the machine came up, the chief wasted no time picking it up between both claws and tossing it into his mouth.

"".......PEH!"" After chewing it for a few long seconds, he spat it out unto the floor with revulsion. ""...Disgusting. It goes down like paste. There's little fat and no firmness.""

Jokan hesitated, glancing at a nearby scientist. ""...But it's edible.""

""You've tested this?""

""It has all the essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals that our meat has. It even contains a higher proportion of zinc.""

""**GRAAAAAH!!**"" Karnak furiously swiped down at the crate, partially cleaving one of its sides with his claws.

An army on Nysis marched for its stomach. He didn't need to consult his staff to know there wouldn't be enough recruits this coming winter. Thanks to the Terrans' meddling, the number of conscripts would increase, and less motivated soldiers meant lower morale in the next assault on Kiyna. No...he might even have to abandon conquest of Kinya altogether and settle for claiming Makila's conomia gardens...

The other whelps in the Coalition had always given the Uvei a comfortable amount of space for them to do their own thing. But these Terrans...they were *too* comfortable inserting themselves into affairs they had no business in. There needed to be a wedge between the two species, as popular as they were with the Uvei at the moment.

""Start preparing reports that Terran meat has caused some Uvei in Kepal to get sick. And release a small portion of our own meat supplies as 'counter-relief'.""

They were a threat, and he might as well use their precious food aid to inform the population of that. 

There was no going back now that cultivated meat was known throughout Nysis, even this...lesser form of it.

""It is laughable arrogance for these Terrans to try to help when they're so primitive. Like a youngling trying to teach its parent to hunt.""

Karnak turned his gaze to the far corners of the lab, where rows upon rows of Uven meat cultures grew elaborately.

""Jokan. Their technology isn't even a match for Uven meat labs from 200 cycles ago, is it?""

""Of course not, Chief.""

""Laughable arrogance. They'll be humbled sooner or later.""

___

Daya the Vesnin could hardly believe it. These past few weeks in this cramped space station residence have been a whirlwind of emotions, but this was...

\[""Jokan. Their technology isn't even a match for Uven meat labs from 200 cycles ago, is it?""

""Of course not, Chief.""\]

How could...? Why would-!?

He glanced over at Gretal, who was trembling.

""**GRAAAAAAAH!!!**""

He was trembling with rage, of course. A week or two ago, this rampage from an Uven would have terrified him, but all he could do now was sympathize as he watched his friend savage the poor pillow pillows in a rampage.

""He-! Because of the famine, Jhokin was...! And-!!!""

Daya hopped on his feet. ""We need to tell the presses! Like with those food officials!""

""No.""

A sluggish voice cut through the tense energy in the room and both aliens turned to their mutual friend, who continued messing with the computer.

""Tch. He managed to break the camera lens when he smashed the crate.""

""N-No, hold on. What do you mean 'no'? Jacey! Aren't you angry?!""

Jacey the human had bags under his eyes and furrowed brows as he cycled to other cameras. At Daya's question, he turned and flashed a grin that sent chills down his spine. It was dripping with malevolence he hadn't seen on any other human.

""Angry? *I promise, I'm furious. And that's why we simply* ***must*** *cut off all escape routes first.*"" He started tapping away at the screen again. ""We can't let this guy get away with some dumb excuse, and we can't let him be a scapegoat. For starters, we have 191 other nations to check on...""

Daya's fur stood on end. Yeah...it was pretty obvious why a human and Uven could get along so well at this point.

...

So why the hell was *he* here between them?

# 7. Stock & Market Analysis

* Stock highly volatile post-pivot; surged 44% after $100M blockchain investment news, then dropped \~92%
* Retail interest spiked (\~25% increase in tracking; 72% increase in social mentions)
* Nasdaq reverse split may be required due to sub-$1 trading price
   * 30 day countdown started whenever stock first began trading below $1, but YYAI has the ability to extend the timer
* Potential dilution from warrants / future capital raises
* Low market cap and float compared to stock price - this was highlighted in another chimp's post yesterday [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystock/comments/1o2k6a9/which\_stock\_will\_explode\_yyai\_gpus\_pcsa\_buru\_scwo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystock/comments/1o2k6a9/which_stock_will_explode_yyai_gpus_pcsa_buru_scwo/)

# 8. Summary / Key Takeaways

* YYAI (AiRWA Inc.) is a **high-risk, high-reward blockchain / RWA play**
* Pivot justified by stagnant sports-tech growth and emerging RWA market
* JuCoin partnership provides **tech, liquidity, and credibility**
* RWA market is real but early; AiRWA aims to be **first retail-accessible RWA exchange**
* Stock is volatile; **regulatory and dilution risks exist**
* Reverse split likely if Nasdaq $1 minimum not achieved, but there is time before this would be necessary for YYAI

YYAI sits at the intersection of **emerging blockchain infrastructure, real-world asset tokenization, and retail-access finance**.

* **Market Potential:** Even capturing a tiny fraction of the $900T global RWA market could multiply the company’s valuation many times over.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Retail-accessible RWA exchanges are scarce; successful execution could position AiRWA as a market leader. This would also be the first partnership that Jucoin initiates in this space, and of this scale ($250M in capital)
* **Strategic Leverage:** JuCoin’s technology, Solana’s blockchain, and Inca Digital’s compliance tools significantly reduce execution risk.
* **Scalability:** Digital asset platforms scale faster than hardware businesses; revenue can grow via trading fees, stablecoin issuance, and licensing.

**Bottom Line:** If AiRWA successfully launches its RWA exchange and gains traction, YYAI could experience **transformational growth**, though execution, regulatory compliance, and market adoption remain critical risks.

1o3ybqp,all,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's support 'helps me to survive,' says a bereaved dad","[https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/860956/prince-harry-meghan-markle-support-helps-bereaved-dad-to-survive-really-care-exclusive/](https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/860956/prince-harry-meghan-markle-support-helps-bereaved-dad-to-survive-really-care-exclusive/)



The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s support has been more than comforting for bereaved parents. For Toney and Brandy Roberts, whose daughter Englyn Maydisyn Roberts took her life five years ago, that support has been personal. “It helps me to survive personally,” Toney exclusively told HELLO! at Project Healthy Minds’ fourth annual World Mental Health Day Festival in New York City. 



“Because I'm normally quiet to myself,” he explained. “If it's not me, it's my wife and the kids, but their support has helped me become more open to talking about how I feel to other men and women, other families that again, I normally would never have met, shouldn't have met, but I don't mind sharing my love and my care with them and receive the same in return. But it's because of Harry and Megan that this is all possible. And, of course our law firm, the Social Media Victims Law Center, they really helped bring us together with Harry and Meghan.”

Toney and his wife Brandy Roberts are both community managers for The Parents' Network, a support network for parents whose children and families have been impacted by online harm, formed by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Archewell Foundation.



The Duke and Duchess have been a part of Toney and Brandy's lives since about three years ago when they heard their stories and took action to get them “involved as a community.” “We just love them and every time we're in their presence, they come and give us this nice hug ,and \[it\] just lets us know that we're heard,” Brandy said. “They're our voice.”

Toney described speaking with Harry and Meghan as feeling like talking to their “brother” and “sister.” He said, “They use their status for good, and that's what people around the world need to realize. They truly have brought families together that shouldn't have never met because of the situation that we're all in. But they're awesome. Totally awesome.”





“I’m glad they met because they have something that you can't teach, and that's 'give a d-mn,'” Toney added. “They really care.”

The night before, at the 2025 Project Healthy Minds Gala — where the Duke and Duchess were honored with the Humanitarians of the Year Award — it was announced that The Parents’ Network would be joining forces with ParentsTogether, a non-profit organization that provides news and resources to families. Prince Harry called the partnership “a natural evolution to enable the community to continue to grow and have more impact alongside the rapid rise of technology.”



Meanwhile, Meghan stated that the expansion “represents both our commitment as well as the acknowledgement that we need to reach more families to create greater and faster change.”



“Together, we can and we will build the movement that all families and all children deserve. We know that when parents come together, when communities unite, waves are made,” the As ever founder continued. “We've seen it happen and we're watching it grow. And with your support, we'll continue building a safer digital world for all of our children.”

1o57181,all,NOVONIX ($NVX) - Potential 5x Coming!,"**NOVNIX ($NVX),** is on the verge of a big upwards trend. I'll preface everything I am about to say with this. I typically stay far away from penny stocks. I think they are extremely volatile and often pump & dumps. However, the opportunity here with NOVONIX is far too great to pass up. Let's get into it.

Founded in 2012, NOVONIX is an Australian based producer of synthetic graphite. During the first quarter of 2025, they relocated their headquarters to Chattanooga, Tennessee. **Now here is the important thing. NOVONIX is the ONLY producer of synthetic graphite in the US**

**What is synthetic graphite and why is it important?** Synthetic graphite is an engineered form of carbon that possesses the necessary properties for the high performance of lithium-ion batteries. In recent years, Li-ion battery demand has been skyrocketing. This is due to the increasing electric vehicle market and battery energy storage systems (BESS), as well as consumer electronics. Li-ion batteries are the best commercially available battery due to their higher energy density and long-life cycle. Graphite is the #1 mineral by mass in all Li-ion batteries, making it highly demanded. Synthetic graphite is sought after because of its high purity. This improves the battery lifespan and performance compared to traditional graphite. Overall, it is superior to regular graphite. The only thing is, it is 3-5x more costly and requires 10x more energy consumption. According to research from the University of Michigan, US synthetic graphite demand is expected to outpace their ability to produce it. In 2020, battery anodes represented just 8% of graphite consumption, with traditional applications like refractories, electrodes, and lubricants dominating at 92%. By 2024, battery anodes captured 28% of the market, and projections indicate this will surge to 62% by 2036. That makes producers like NOVONIX extremely valuable when once again, THEY ARE THE ONLY US PRODUCER!

You might ask, why the hell do you care about a synthetic graphite producer with a market cap of $337 million? Well, here's why.

""China producers control approximately 85-90% of spherical graphite production, and over 95% of synthetic graphite anode manufacturing."" Once again, the main thesis comes down to the US not being able to rely on China for critical materials anymore.

On July 5th of 2025, The US Commerce Department imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties of 93.5% on graphite imports from China effective July 17th, 2025. Anti-dumping relates to the Chinese producers ""dumping"" their graphite into the US at a lower than fair market price. ""Dumping is a malicious trade practice used by China to undercut competition and wield geopolitical influence. It is all made possible by a combination of massive subsidies and other state-sponsored policies"" (S&P Global).

According to American Active Anode Material Producer (a coalition representing North Americas graphite producers) spokesperson, Erik Olsonsaidin, the cumulative rate on China's active anode materials is now 160% when adding the new policy onto preexisting anode tariffs. In December of 2024, the AAAMP initiated a petition with the Department of Commerce, seeking a tariff as high as 920%. This is based on the grounds that China's state subsidies and artificially low prices are undermining the establishment of industry in the US. ""The US does not mine natural graphite. The country relies entirely on imports to meet its graphite requirements"" (S&P Global).

On **October 9th of 2025**, China's Ministry of Commerce restricted the export of Dual-Use items. This means companies wanting to export certain things will have to apply for approval to the Chinese government. It also means the Chinese government fully controls the supply chain now and will likely deny a significant portion of export requests... The export controls could lead to supply shortages and supply chain management issues for overseas markets. Below is a list of restricted items.

* Rechargeable and dischargeable lithium-ion batteries (including cells and battery packs) with an energy density of 300 wh/kg or higher.
* Technology & equipment for the production of batteries above.
* Graphite anode material-related items.
* Synthetic graphite anode materials.
* Equipment and materials used to produce graphite anode material.

Following this announcement, Trump has stated there will be a new 100% tariff on goods from China, further escalating the tension between the two nations.

**Now, back to NOVONIX...** They have three business segments which are: Battery Materials, Battery Technology, and Graphite Exploration. The one we are focused on here is Battery Materials. This segment is responsible for the creation of synthetic graphite.

Currently, the company is producing synthetic graphite in their Riverside Facility in Chattanooga, TN. **This facility is poised to become the first large-scale production site for SG in North America, with plans to grow output to 20,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).** They are expanding and opening a new facility called Enterprise South, which will be able to produce 31,500 tpa by the end of 2028. The company will have total production capacity of over 50,000 tpa by 2028.

**BIG NEWS:** On September 29th, 2025, the Riverside Facility delivered its first mass production sample of commercial grade SG. This delivery marks a huge milestone for the company, demonstrating their ability to produce at scale. This is key given the fact that NOVONIX already has customers lined up. Their key customers as of now are Panasonic Energy, Stellantis, and PowerCo SE (Volkswagen's battery arm).

Here are the details of those purchase agreements:

**Panasonic Energy** \- In February of 2024, the companies signed a binding offtake agreement for SG supply. Panasonic agreed to buy at least 10,000 tonnes of anode material for use in their US power plants over the term of 2025-2028. This commitment is subject to NOVONIX achieving agreed upon milestones regarding final mass production qualification timelines prior to Q4 2025. Panasonic has the right to reduce the 10,000 tonne offtake volume up to 20% if these milestones are not achieved by the required dates or terminate the agreement if there is a substantial delay in achieving these milestones.

**Stellantis -** On November 10th, 2024, the two companies entered into a binding offtake agreement for a minimum of 86,250 tonnes, up to a target volume of 115,000 tonnes of high-performance SG material. This material will be supplied to Stellantis cell manufacturing partners in North America over a six-year term starting in 2026. This offtake agreement lasts until 2031. In a statement from prior NOVONIX CEO Dr. Chris Burns, ""This contract allocates the remainder of our available volumes at our Riverside facility and a portion of volumes to be produced at our planned greenfield facility. Offtake agreements with high-quality partners such as Stellantis solidify NOVONIX’s position as a leader in onshoring the supply chain of synthetic graphite and accelerating the adoption of clean energy.”

**PowerCO SE -** On November 25th, 2024, NOVONIX announced a binding offtake agreement with PowerCO for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes of high-performance SG. The material will be supplied over a five-year term starting in 2027.

**Key Strategic Partnership W/Phillips 66 -** Phillips 66 is a leading global manufacturer of specialty coke, which is a precursor material for the process of synthetic graphite production. In 2022, they acquired a 16% stake in NOVONIX valued at $150 million. In a statement made by prior NOVONIX CEO, Dr. Chris Burns, ""We believe NOVONIX is currently the only supplier with plans to provide large volumes of synthetic graphite anode material in the U.S., and this partnership will accelerate our mission to establish a North American supply chain to power the growing battery sector and facilitate a sustainable future.” This partnership gives NOVONIX a stable and immediate supply of specialty coke in order to produce SG.

**A History of US Government Funding for NOVONIX -** With all of the investment news recently with companies like MP, LAC, and Intel, I find it important to mention the history of support the US has provided to NVX.

In October of 2023, the company received a $100 million grant from the US Department of Energy due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand manufacturing of batteries for EVs.

In April of 2024, the company was selected to receive a $103 million tax credit under the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Allocation Program to support the critical production of battery materials from its Riverside facility.

In December of 2024, The DOE made a conditional loan commitment to NOVONIX for a total value of $754.8 million. $692 million being principal and $62.8 million being capitalized interest. This loan is set to help NOVONIX finance their Enterprise South facility. This facility has not been selected under the 48C program. The company is working with the loan programs office to be approved for the necessary requirements to be eligible for the loan. Things like environmental reviews, final design and cost confirmations, etc.

**This all leads us to today.** The company has signed a definitive agreement to purchase a 182-acre parcel in Enterprise South Park in Chattanooga. The land will be acquired for $5 million and serve as NOVONIX's second facility for production of high-performance synthetic graphite. The company is expected to receive $54 million in total net tax and other benefits from the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County over a 15-year period, contingent upon meeting specific conditions outlined in the agreement. The company does not intend to close on the purchase of the Enterprise South land until the conditions related to the committed $754 million loan have been satisfied.

[](https://preview.redd.it/novonix-nvx-potential-5x-coming-v0-jmjmupfrwruf1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51db6a6da9956754d751d6919d4ee816b02cf16)

**What does their financial position look like?** Similar to my points made with $MP, the past financials don't mean a damn thing to be quite honest. If you looked at NOVONIX purely based on financials, you'd laugh. The stock trades around $2 - $3 for a reason. The only thing we need to be concerned about here is their position in terms of a possible bankruptcy. At the moment, they are operating at an average yearly loss of $58.96 million over the last 5 years. As of their last report, Cash & ST Investments sit at $24.8 million, which has steadily decreased from $142.7 million in June of 2022. Although, total receivables have more than doubled in the last year, going from $8.2 million in December of 2024 to $18.9 million as of their last report. They have a current ratio of .9x and a quick ratio of .8x. Total Assets are $239 million compared to $95.2 million in Total Liabilities. The most concerning thing in terms of financials is their negative Altman Z-score of -1. Management has stated that their expansion plans will require additional funding outside of their cash position. So, there is a realistic likelihood that this company could go bankrupt without further funding.

As I mentioned, the company needs funding. In July of 2025, NOVONIX entered into an agreement with Yorkville Advisor Global. NOVONIX is to issue up to $100 million of unsecured convertible debentures. Yorkville has agreed to provide NOVONIX with funding up to $57 million under the first two tranches of the agreement. So, they have already received $23.275 million from this deal under the first tranche. The second tranche has been issued on September 10th after a NOVONIX general meeting. This means they have the ability to get the additional $33.725 million. This is a complex financial deal that provides NOVONIX access to funding. The key thing is they just got $23.275 million.

**New & Growth-Oriented CEO -** On January 20th, 2025, CEO Dr. Chris Burns stepped down after running the company since September of 2020. Burns is still with the company, serving as a special advisor to the board. The company is entering a new growth phase, and the board was expressing their desire for a CEO with strong experience in manufacturing, operations, and scaling. Enter Michael O'Kronely. O'Kronely took over the company on May 19th, 2025. He brings significant experience to NOVONIX, with 30 years in the automotive sector, 15 of those being in lithium-ion battery and battery materials work. Prior to joining NOVONIX, he was the CEO of Ascend Elements which is a battery recycling and materials company. Over a 5-year tenure with Ascend, O'Kronely increased the enterprise value of the company by $1.6 billion. He has a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering from the University of Michigan.

[NOVONIX CEO Michael O'Kronely](https://preview.redd.it/ske403irbsuf1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f69f1803d7f1105b4d04a0a77947ea9ee436e11)

[](https://preview.redd.it/novonix-nvx-potential-5x-coming-v0-3rgx2n3n4suf1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fe57b09fb8017934dc0fcf5b7dc1cc4f9c64c5)

**Conclusion -** With all of that being said, NOVONIX has massive amounts of upside at only \~ **$2.5 - $3** a share. The ongoing geopolitical tension between the US and China is causing the rapid development of a domestic supply chain. Things only got worse within the last 2 days after China announced restrictions on many key exports like synthetic graphite, anode & cathode equipment and technology, etc. Followed by a Trump announcement of an additional 100% tariff on everything Chinese. NOVONIX is in a great spot as they are the only producer of synthetic graphite in the US, which is critical to the American supply chain due to its necessity in the EV, BESS, and consumer electronic markets. They have just delivered their first sample, proving they are capable of quality production. Because of this, I fully expect that the DOE loan will be granted to NOVONIX soon. They already have the land and are ready to start expanding production, just need that loan approval. Once this happens, it opens the flood gates for more purchase agreements to come in, and more investment. Currently at **$2.94** a share, I think this stock could easily reach the **$10 - $15 range within months** if all goes according to plan. Obviously, there is significant risk with the company's financial position that is hard to ignore, however, my thesis negates those. The upside potential here is massive. I believe this would be a good fit in any portfolio with proper risk management.

1o5ddim,all,Salary Series Part 6: How to find a new job (with downloadable templates),">*It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.* | Steve Jobs

[*Link to blog post here*](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/) *for images and readability*

# Key takeaways

* Your career profile is not just your CV. Carefully crafting your profile into a clear, compelling narrative and succinct pitch will elevate your success in the job search
* Networking is key to accessing the hidden job market, and it doesn’t need to be cringey or inauthentic
* Preparing for interviews is more than just thinking about answers to typical interview questions. Extensive research, deep analysis, forming a point of view and aligning on a 90-day plan will help you stand out

# Introduction

Welcome to part 6 of my Salary Series! In my previous post, I discussed the [dynamics of the recruitment marketplace](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). The purpose of that post was to provide you with a deep understanding of how hirers search for and shortlist candidates. In this post, we’re going to leverage that information to help you succeed in the job search.

From my observations, the average candidate would search and apply for opportunities by:

* Searching for jobs on one, at most two job platforms (JobStreet by SEEK and/or LinkedIn)
* Mass apply for jobs, using one standard CV or a customised CV leveraging AI (which doesn’t give you an advantage)
* Hope and pray for a response
* Attend interviews with limited research based on browsing the company website

I’m here to help give you some different meta strategies to elevate your job search game.

Ready? Let’s dive in.

**Disclaimer:** I won’t be covering basic information that is easily found elsewhere. I’m going to assume you already know the basics and have the same knowledge and process steps that the “average candidate” has.

# Advanced job search strategies

In the job search process, standing out to get the best opportunities and offers requires a lot more effort than you might imagine.. As a result, the job search process starts a lot earlier than you think. There’s a whole lot of preparation, extensive search and networking, as well as in-depth research to perform for each opportunity.

In each section below, I’ll provide detailed information on what an above-average job-searcher would be doing. I won’t be covering generic, basic advice that you can easily find (so I expect you know the basics).

# 1.0 Profile Development

The first and most important step in the job search is building up a high-impact, attractive and credible profile. This includes your personal brand, credentials and experience. From day one of your first job, you need to build a strong personal brand, with the right skills, with the right work experience. Of course, these would need to be aligned with your career goals and objectives. Without a strong profile, your job search will be many, many times harder.

Whatever the case, your profile as of now is what it is, and you have to make the best of it.

# 1.1 Detailed CV Knowledge Bank

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

The first step I highly recommend is to develop a detailed CV knowledge bank, which is essentially **a database of every single responsibility, initiative and achievement throughout your whole professional career**.

In your typical CV, a single project or achievement is articulated in a single bullet point. In a detailed CV, that one bullet point is expanded to be half a page or even one whole page. The detailed CV may be 20, 30 or even 50 pages long.

Yes, it will take some time. And a lot of effort trying to search for and compile all your past information, data points and feedback from all your past work experience. But it’s going to be worth it.

# What’s the purpose of creating such a document?

* You have a central repository of all your work history, achievements and impact
* This allows you to easily and efficiently customise your job application CV by referring to your repository, picking and choosing the most relevant experiences (a lot better than just customising keywords, am I right?)
* It can be used to prepare responses for difficult situational or behavioural interview questions. By writing it down in extreme, explicit detail, you gain clarity and specificity in the answers that you would have rehearsed
* You can go even deeper with the hirer if requested. There was one opportunity where I was asked for more specific information (on top of my CV) about my experience in Corporate Strategy work. I ended up submitting a 10+ slide deck with all the relevant Corporate Strategy experience extracted from my detailed CV. Easy peasy

>**BONUS:** Download a [sample of the Detailed CV Knowledge Bank here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-sample-vShare.pdf). Also, I've made available a [Detailed CV Knowledge Bank template](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-template-vShare.pptx) you can download and use

This tool is not going to be useful unless you write down every piece of work you have done in great detail, including quantitative data points, as well as measurable outcomes, as a result of what you have done. You need to write down information such as “Facilitated 4 workshops comprising 75 stakeholders in total, leading to the identification and prioritisation of 150 requirements/user stories.”

It’s going to be A LOT of work trawling your whole email archive, shared folders, old CVs, etc., to find and consolidate all the information from your work history. However, future updates will be relatively quick, say 30-60 minutes every quarter.

# 1.2 Career strategy, narrative and elevator pitch

Now that you have compiled your detailed CV, you have built an extensive view of your whole career. It will give you the clarity and foundation to help formulate your vision for your career.

That’s the next step before performing a job search. Being clear on the career you want, which translates into your career strategy, what pathway you want to take, as well as what you need to do to get there. Your career strategy and pathway give you focus on the types of jobs, industries and companies you should target in your job search.

Which then leads to formulating your profile narrative and elevator pitch.

**The narrative** of your career experience and where it’s headed. It’s a compelling story that articulates what you’ve done, why you’ve made certain decisions and what you may aim to do in the future. For example, my narrative is:

>I started out the first 10 years of my career in stockbroking and wealth management in one company, where I was given new opportunities and promotions almost every 2 years due to my ability to deliver results

>Towards the end of those 10 years, I realised that whilst I had great vertical progression, I only had experience in one division, of one company, in one industry my whole career.

>I realised that it was important for my career development to gain a breadth of exposure across many different functions, divisions and companies. That’s when I decided to pivot into consulting, which would provide that breadth of exposure in a compressed timeframe. Hence, I joined an MBA program that would allow me to exit into consulting

>I also decided to work in Asia, to gain exposure into a different environment and working culture.

>Since the MBA, I have spent another 10 years across two consulting firms and headed up strategy at an investment bank, where I gained significant experience in a broad range of functions and types of financial services firms

>As a next step in my career, I’m looking for an opportunity to consolidate my wealth of experiences in leadership skills into a position that has high visibility and high impact as a senior executive

**Your elevator pitch** is a 30-second summary of your profile and narrative that makes you a unique and highly sought-after candidate. The elevator pitch is something you use when you introduce yourself to a new connection or an interviewer when faced with the “Tell me about yourself” question. It needs to be succinct, specific, yet punchy. An example, based on the narrative above, would be:

>*Across my career, I’ve built a unique balance of depth and breadth having both industry and consulting experience. I started as a skilled operator across client management, product management and partnerships in wealth management, where I delivered consistent results and rose rapidly through the ranks. Later, I broadened my perspective through consulting and strategy leadership roles across multiple financial institutions and markets in Asia. What ties it all together after almost 20 years is my ability to navigate complexity, drive clarity, and lead teams to deliver impact. At this stage, I’m focused on bringing that full spectrum of experience into a senior executive role that allows me to shape strategy and deliver measurable outcomes at scale.*

# 1.3 Online profiles (LinkedIn, Jobstreet, GitHub, etc)

If you don’t have [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/)and [Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/) accounts, you’re limiting your visibility with hirers. Without setting up accounts on these job platforms, you won’t have an online profile that showcases your professional work experience. Without an online profile, how do you think hirers can find you when they are performing proactive searches for candidates?

Hirers and especially recruiters use these platforms to find matching candidates. As someone who has a complete profile which showcases that I work for top firms with impactful experience, I often get messages and invitations from hirers and recruiters to explore opportunities that they have.

Also, don’t limit yourself to just [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/)and [Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/). You should be building your profile in places where people in your industry congregate. For example, if you’re a software engineer, you should be showcasing your work on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

# 2.0 Pipeline Development

The next step is to start building your pipeline of opportunities. Don’t forget about the [hidden job market when searching for opportunities](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). You’ll need to track and manage this pipeline through a single process using a single workflow.

# 2.1 Pipeline Management Tool

First of all, you need a pipeline management tool. It’s a document or file that you can keep track of the job search process, and note down all opportunities you have and manage each opportunity’s status.

Here’s a screenshot of what that might look like:

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

You will want to have two sheets in your spreadsheet:

1. **Company list:** A worksheet with a list of companies you are targeting to find opportunities; and
2. **Opportunity list:** A worksheet with a list of identified job opportunities

>**Bonus**: Download a [copy of the template here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx) for your own use

Let me explain how you should update the two lists:

**Company list**

If you’ve ever read the [2-hour job search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/), skip this section. You already know what to do here. I think it’s a great and highly effective method to not only focus your efforts, but also develop your network.

The very quick summary is as follows:

* List as many companies as you would like to work for. This should take just 10-15 minutes tops
* Do online research to identify companies which are similar to the companies you wrote down on your list. Examples of how to do this:
   * Use the LinkedIn search function with the names of your companies in the list, and use the “find similar” function. This will help you find other companies which you might want to explore
   * Search by industry/function and browse job listings, look out for companies which you haven’t heard of and research them
* Map out any connections/networks you know who are currently or previously working in these companies. Use LinkedIn and your contact list. Mark that down in your list
* Score the company list using the instructions I provided in the tool (e.g. look on JobStreet by SEEK and LinkedIn for job ads by that company for “Posting” score)
* Rank (or rather, sort) the list so the highest score with a potential connection appears at the top of the list

This will result in a list of companies to focus your efforts on, penetrating the [hidden job market](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/) using networks and connections

**Opportunity List**

I list all opportunities in this sheet, even if they’re not on my Company List sheet. More instructions are [inside the downloadable tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx).

How do I go about searching for opportunities and populating this sheet?

* **Proactive search:** Whenever a recruiter approaches you with an opportunity you might be interested in, record it down
* **Networking:** Whenever someone you have a coffee catch-up or an [informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview) with offers a referral or highlights an opening, record it down
* **Job advertisement search:** The average person uses one, maybe two job portals at most to do their job search. Don’t be average. I do a “total market scan” because I’m a maximiser. Let’s say I want to find a job in Financial Services (Banks, Insurers, Wealth Management, etc).
   * I would search using:
      * Large job portals: [JobStreet by SEEK](https://www.jobstreet.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and [Indeed](http://indeed.com/).
      * Specialised job boards: [eFinancialCareers](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/)
      * Company careers page: That company list you created? Visit the careers section for every one of them
      * Recruiters: Michael Page / Page Executive, Robert Walters, Hays, Ambition, Ranstad, etc.
   * That list should amount to 50-60 websites you’re searching for job opportunities at any one time. Rinse and repeat. Every day for large job portals. The others, weekly.

50 – 60 websites for a job search may seem excessive. But you want to make sure you **identify every single relevant opportunity**. Here’s what you do:

* For large portals, you can save your search criteria so you don’t have to set it up each time.
* Always ensure you sort the search results from the most recent job ad to the oldest
* Copy into [the tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx) all the opportunities you’re interested in
* The first time you do this, it may take a few hours (or 1-2 days) to go through every single search result over the past couple of weeks
* But once you’re done with the backlog, if you’re searching the large portals every day, you only need to scroll through one day’s worth of new job advertisements based on your search criteria. For each large job portal, that might be just 5 – 10 minutes. And the rest of the websites you’ll do weekly, that might be an hour or so once a week

# 2.2 Tapping the hidden job market

Now that we have our pipeline, we need to start focusing on the hidden job market. No point applying for job ads, then sit back and watch Netflix whilst waiting for responses. Time to ensure we get a hold of the best opportunities.

**Proactive search**

If you’ve done your online profiles right (It’s only taken many, many years of hard work and achievements to build your profile, and just 60 minutes to condense it online), the proactive search opportunities will start coming.

There’s a lot of information online on how to make your online profile attractive, so I won’t cover that. Some other important advice:

* Always keep your profile up to date, even when you’re not job hunting. The more up-to-date the information, the more information the hirer has about you
* Be active. Even if that’s casually browsing, commenting or liking posts. These platforms inform hirers and recruiters of user behaviour, such as when you’re browsing job ads, when you’re reading their company posts, etc. These are strong interest signals
* Instead, show activity on job platforms. Follow companies. Post POVs. Comment, like. Recruiters can see your high-level activity on these platforms. You want to portray yourself as “casually browsing”, not “open to work”, which can be a sign of desperation
* Do not put open to work. Unfortunately, there is a hidden stigma around candidates who have their profile as “open to work”.

**Networking**

Most people have negative perceptions of networking. It’s cringe. It’s slimy and inauthentic. It’s a lot of chest beating and schmoozing.

That’s what TV shows and inexperienced people tell you about networking.

Most (effective) networking is NOT about turning up to a conference, shaking hands with strangers and exchanging business cards.

The best networkers **grow their network organically and give back more than they receive**. Let me explain.

Ever heard of [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)? Whilst it may be inaccurate to some degree, the premise can still hold. Why try blind luck in trying to meet others, when your closest connections (friends, family, colleagues) could introduce you to new connections? And when you build a relationship with the new connections, they could potentially introduce you to a whole new degree of connections.

Some tips and tricks to help (because I can write a whole new post about networking):

* **You will always have different “levels” of connections in your network.** You have a close inner circle, a warm network, and a not-so-warm (cold) network. How often you engage with them depends on the level
* **Always be curious and helpful.** When building relationships, be genuinely curious about their perspective, insights and experiences.
* **Give back as much as possible.** Offer to help others without expecting anything in return. Read the book [Give and Take by Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/book/give-and-take/).
* **The best networkers help connect others.** Have a friend in banking who wants to create a fintech startup and wants to learn from a developer? If you know a rockstar developer, connect them
* **Ask to be connected.** Reach out and ask your connections if they know anyone employed in companies on your preferred list, or even generally if they know anyone in that industry or job function that they could connect you to for an informational interview. Rinse and repeat
* **Build and constantly update a networking list.** This may sound weird. Some networkers swear by it. Some don’t like it. It’s a list of your connections, with relevant notes. Most useful information to keep:
   * Profile/background
   * When you last met/talked to them
   * What you’ve talked about and what they have done for you
   * What you have done for them (so you make sure you always do more for others)
   * Interesting information that helps remember who they are and what’s important to them

To be more specific in the job search context, I think of networking in two general categories:

* **Company-specific networking**
   * Based on the companies you do want to work for, reach out to people who work in these companies to do informational interviews. Sometimes these may be a cold message on LinkedIn or email (reach the [2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/) on how to do this)
   * If you are looking at an opportunity in a different team, ask for a connection referral to meet someone in that team
   * If you don’t know anyone in that company, use LinkedIn to find second-degree connections, meaning someone who knows someone who works in that company. Ask for a connection referral
* **Industry-wide networking**
   * Connect with others in your network who are in the industry (again, [2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/))
   * Ask to be connected with others, say you’re looking to explore opportunities across the industry

# 3.0 Interview preparation

Now that you’re getting opportunities in the pipeline, you’ll need to start focusing on preparing for upcoming interviews.  It’s more than just thinking about the answers to a few questions and watching a few YouTube videos on how to answer generic interview questions.

# 3.1 Background research

On top of the usual background research, such as browsing the company’s website and annual reports to understand how the business works, its history, scope, mission and vision, etc., you should be going deeper and more specific into your functional area.

Additional avenues of research are:

* Connections within your network who currently or have previously worked in the company
* Glassdoor and similar websites to understand the general employee sentiment, what people think about the culture, ways of working, etc.
* Interviews, news articles and podcasts from company leaders, especially those that are from your functional area of the organisation. This helps you understand how they think, the challenges that they’re trying to solve, trends they are monitoring, and what their priorities are
* GenAI / LLMs now offer deep research capabilities. Use this to your advantage
* Analyst reports if the company you’re interviewing for is publicly listed
* Industry publications and reports for wider information about the market they’re in

# 3.2 Deep dive analysis

**Analysis is different from research**. Research is gathering information. Analysis is interpreting the data to gain insights that will help you gain a deeper understanding and your point of view on the company

Overall, you’ll want to understand the key trends and challenges the company is facing, its strategy, and how this affects the role and the team that you’re interviewing for.

Examples of analysis that you could conduct:

* **Competitive analysis:** If the role you’re applying for is a strategic, commercial or similar role where understanding the competitive landscape is important, you’ll want to understand the competitive environment. Market shares, competitive advantages, points of differentiation, competitive responses, etc.
* **Sales productivity:** Understanding the productivity of the sales / frontline team. If you’re interviewing for a sales leader role, you could analyse and benchmark how productive the sales force is versus competitors (e.g. revenue per sales headcount, revenue per branch, etc)
* **Product deployment velocity:** If you’re interviewing for a product manager or software engineer role, you could analyse the “changelog” for a mobile app, feature announcements, etc., and map a timeline of new features and product announcements over time. You can then also compare that to product/tech headcount or expenses, in addition to increases in capital expenditures for new technologies, to uncover insights into how effective they are in deploying human and financial capital to develop new products, as well as how fast their product development cycle is and how it has changed over time.

The types of analysis you could do have no bounds. It really depends on the type of role you’re applying for. You just need to spend some time thinking about what would be a meaningful analysis that you can then extend into great probing questions to ask, or into your point of view on how to solve those challenges you have uncovered from your analysis.

If possible, do try to validate some of your analysis with anyone in your network that is in a position to do so (without breaching any confidentiality or divulging private company information).

# 3.3 Preparing for interview questions

Now that you have an in-depth view of the company, the function and role you’re applying for, the next step is to prepare responses to questions that may be asked in the interviews.

There’s a mountain of information online about this, so I’ll cover the most important principles to elevate how you respond to interview questions:

* Develop a response bank for interview questions. Write… it… down. No excuses. Don’t think about the responses in your head and assume you’ve prepared. Word document, Excel, PowerPoint, or physical notebook. Doesn’t matter. This is mandatory, so don’t skip it
* Use the research and deep dive analysis you have conducted to formulate responses that are specific, deep and insightful (if this applies to any of the questions)
* The best overall strategy is to “steer” your answers to reinforce your elevator pitch and career narrative. This paints a congruent profile that showcases you as the strongest candidate.
   * If your elevator pitch is that you’re the best deal closer for Enterprise Sales, design the interview responses accordingly. For example, when asked a question “how do you deal with conflict?”, you could use a story of how your pre-sales consultant angered a potential new client, but you managed to resolve the conflict, which led to the client signing a deal with you.
* Practice your responses out loud in front of a mirror. Even better, record your practice sessions and watch them. The best communicators do this as part of presentation preparation
* Do live interview practice with a partner. This is the closest and best way to prepare for real interviews. The tricky part is finding someone to help you. Buy them lunch.

# 3.4 Develop a Point of View (POV)

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

Once you have more experience and are looking for more senior roles, going into interviews with your own Point of View or outside-in analysis will be extremely powerful. **Developing a POV document is my secret weapon to stand out against the competition**.

The POV document is a document that contains a piece of analysis or research that you’ve conducted on the company (or function within, or industry) that shows you have a relevant opinion or perspective. The more senior you are, the more important it is to have a view, express your opinion and add value to conversations. Why should an interview be any different?

I’ve used these documents in my past interviews with success. In one instance, as a result of the document, they expanded the role title and job scope offered to me. They were impressed and had confidence that I could take on a bigger role with more responsibilities.

It **showcases your knowledge, experience and ability to form a view**. It shows you can actually think deeply and reflect on a topic. It shows proactiveness. It shows that you’re different.

There is no easy step-by-step guide for this. I will, however, share a few tips:

* The right length would be about 3-4 slides or pages
* It should be about a trending topic that would highly resonate with the hiring manager
* Make it specific to the company. Leverage the deep dive analysis you have done previously. Gather intel from your networking
* If possible, send it to the hiring manager or interviewer (via HR if needed) a few days before the interview. This allows the interviewer to read it before the interview, which makes it easy for you to bring it up and discuss it during the face-to-face interview. Remember to bring printed out versions into the interview

>**Bonus:** Download a [sample of what a POV document looks like here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-Interview-POV-sample-vShare.pdf). This is a sanitised version of a POV document that I created quite a number of years ago.

Note that this document is more suited for senior or managerial positions. If you’re a grad, I don’t recommend doing this.

# 3.5 Preparing questions for the interviewer

Crucially important are the questions you ask during an interview. Most people ask questions like:

>*What do you enjoy most about working in Company A?*

>*How is AI changing the way your company is doing XYZ*

>*What are the skills and behaviours of those who are successful in the role?*

Those are average and boring questions. Instead, ask:

>*Can you tell me a moment of truth through a behaviour or action by a senior leader in Company A that inspired you? (This reveals what the company stands for, how leadership takes ownership, and what type of culture/values the company spreads to its employees)*

>*In what way is your company differentiating itself from competitors when leveraging AI, considering that according to research, 90% of AI implementations in corporate environments has not delivered any value?*

>*What are the strengths of your current team members, and as a result, what are the gaps in skills and experience you are looking for in this role that will be complementary?*

There are also questions to portray that you’re looking to make an impact, get your hands dirty and are looking to make the hiring manager’s life easier, such as:

>*How can I ensure that I am involved in the key strategic projects of this company? (Remember this gem?)*

>*What keeps you up at night, and how can this role help you solve these challenges?*

Also, don’t forget to develop a pointed set of questions which are specific, nuanced and well thought through based on your research and deep dive analysis. Such as:

>*Among the top 3 insurers, by my calculations, your “annualised premium agent ratio” is the lowest according to the most recent annual reports (read out your calculated figures). Based on my analysis, this might be because your commission payout ratio is the lowest amongst the top 3. Is this true, and is your company looking into measures to uplift agent sales productivity?*

The point is, the interviewer will sit up straight and notice that the questions you’re asking are coming from someone experienced who is asking the right questions and has thought deeply about them. That’s how you stand out.

Also, many of these deeper and more specific questions may reveal the real culture, ways of working and deeper insights into the company’s values.

# 3.6 First 90-day plan

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

When you’re on your final interview (or with the hiring manager), this is where you land the plane. A 90-day plan is a **list of goals that you want to achieve within the first 3 months of the role** (with associated activities to support).

In a previous interview, hopefully you will have asked questions about what is expected of the role, especially in the first 90 days. Use this information to develop a 90-day plan that you can “present” back to the hiring manager. This has many benefits:

* **It reinforces your proactiveness**, which is an extremely desirable quality in a candidate. You are ready to start the job. You know how to hit the ground running
* **You can use it to manage expectations and align on the responsibilities of the role.** Present the 90-day plan as a first draft and ask for feedback. Does the hiring manager think there are enough activities and milestones? Does the hiring manager think you need more time to meet stakeholders? You can then further iterate on the plan so you know how to succeed when you start
* **You establish yourself in the hiring manager’s mind as an employee.** As you discuss and iterate on the plan together, you’re already collaboratively engaging each other as if you’re already working together. This gives the hiring manager clarity and the ability to see what it’s like working with you

When developing a 90-day plan, a few things to keep in mind:

* Always position it as a first draft. You have no idea what it’s like working there, and by seeking feedback, you position yourself as someone willing to learn, take feedback and a collaborator
* All 90-day plans should have:
   * Meeting team members and stakeholders (so you establish relationships)
   * Some form of orientation/learning
   * Some kind of achievement or small win, with an observable impact. Perhaps it’s improving the way or working, or a process. Or maybe completing a small project. This shows you can deliver results

Here’s another sample of what a 90-day plan might look like:

# 4.0 Getting Offers

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’ve done the hard work, and you can now reap the benefits. If you haven’t done so already, make sure you read my post on [how to negotiate the salary for your job offer](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-4-how-to-negotiate-a-new-job-offer/).

Once you’ve accepted a job offer, do not forget to politely turn down the other job offers (whilst keeping the connection/relationship open to explore opportunities in the future).

Because you never stop the job search process. Once a job search ends, another new job search takes its place.

# Closing Thoughts

That brings an end to part 6 of my Salary Series. I started this series talking about the [overall labour market and how wages in Malaysia remain stagnant](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-unpacking-the-challenges-in-malaysia/), and over the course of this Salary Series, I gave you deeper and deeper insights and practical advice on negotiating salaries and finding jobs.

So that’s it for now. This series of posts on salary has been ongoing for many months, and I’m looking forward to writing about other personal finance topics. There’s just so much depth to personal finance that I want to write about. But if there’s a specific topic on salaries/jobs which you want to know more about, let me know.

1o2sbio,all,"Medicare Advantage and Part D Compression, Economic stress, and Clover Health.","Hello Fellow Apes,

Since the star rating for Medicare Advantage and Part D came out today, I am cranking out a late night DD for the shorts to enjoy as they short Clov.

[https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2025-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-star-ratings](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2025-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-star-ratings)

I have to admit, I was genuinely shocked when I saw the list. The level of star rating compression is staggering, and I fully anticipate a wave of lawsuits to follow. The average star rating is currently 3.92, and based on these trends, it looks like it could drop even lower next year.

What’s particularly alarming is how many plans have been pushed down to the 3.5-star range—a massive shift from previous years. Even more striking, there are only 7 plans that achieved a 5-star rating this year, compared to 38 plans last year. That’s a dramatic decline, and it’s going to have major implications for bonus payments, rebates, and competitive positioning in the Medicare Advantage landscape. Additionally, with the compression, the playing field is more leveled, and we're going to see some fierce competition from the companies in terms of offering. Before we go any further, I want to explain why things are getting harder.

https://preview.redd.it/z75h2rvii7uf1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=006cabb65e62ce992c7286e2826117408bd4aafa

CMS reports that many measure-level cut points increased from 2024 to 2025. That means for a given measure (for example, cancer screening or readmissions), plans have to perform better (get a higher raw metric) to hit the same star threshold as before. Part of this is due to statistical adjustments: CMS applies Tukey outlier deletion to remove extreme low-end outliers (so they don’t pull down cut points), which tends to push cut points upward.

The CMS fact sheet notes that the performance distribution has become more compressed, meaning many Medicare Advantage plans are performing at relatively high levels. In some measures--such as breast cancer screening--there are a large number of high-scoring plans clustered at the top end of the scale.

This creates a situation where CMS must raise the cut points (thresholds) for each star level, because when everyone scores high, the only way to differentiate between plans is to tighten the grading curve.

In other words, CMS is now grading more like a top-tier university: even if most students score 80%, some will still end up with Bs or Cs simply because the grading curve forces a spread between low, middle, and top performers.

That’s the core issue--even if overall quality across the industry improves, fewer plans can achieve 4 or 5 stars under this compressed distribution. This isn’t necessarily because plans got worse, but because the bar has been pushed higher to keep relative differences between plans.

CMS says there were no major methodological overhauls for 2025. Only minor tweaks, such as increasing the weight for one measure (Plan All-Cause Readmissions) and applying “bi-directional guardrails” on certain measure cut point changes. But importantly: even with mostly stable methodology, the effect of higher cut points means that more performance is needed to achieve a given star level. This kind of prove the point I mentioned above. Because many cut points moved upward, plans need better performance to earn the same star level. That is effectively making it harder. Even without radical methodological changes, these upward shifts in cut points plus a tighter distribution mean more plans will fail to meet thresholds they may have earlier met. The statistics confirm that many fewer plans got the top rating (5 stars), and fewer had 4+ star ratings in 2025. That suggests more plans lost stars or got downgraded.

In short, every MA company got fucked. However, only Clov will be dropping like crazy because it is being targeted by the shorts. Even though Humana overall plans are 3.5 stars, it is not and will not be dropped like crazy compared to Clov. They will be getting the same type of bonus in 2027, and Clov will get a higher bonus in 2025-2026... but Clov will drop because of shorting.

Should you be worried about this? Honestly, that’s not something I can answer definitively--and we’re not here to provide financial advice. What I can say is that the company itself remains fundamentally strong. There’s no indication that it’s at risk of being delisted, and the upcoming earnings report may even surprise a lot of people in a positive way.

Why do I say that? Because Clover Health continues to maintain an industry-leading HEDIS score, which accounts for roughly 24% of the total weighted Star Rating calculation. That means the company is still outperforming many of its peers in clinical outcomes and quality of care--the most important part of healthcare delivery.

It is disappointing--and honestly surprising--that Clover lost 0.5 stars despite delivering stellar health outcomes. In my view, the downgrade wasn’t driven by clinical performance but likely by non-clinical factors such as member experience scores, service issues, and grievance filings.

These areas have been impacted by broader systemic disruptions in the healthcare landscape, including staffing shortages, network strain, and administrative hurdles tied to policy shifts under the current administration and HR-related bottlenecks.

* Patients are understandably frustrated when they can’t find a provider quickly--but at the end of the day, Clover is an insurance company, not a direct care provider. They can set networks, but they can’t control the entire healthcare delivery system.

With that said, I want to underscore what Andrew mentioned in the recent press release regarding the star rating downgrade--because it provides important context and direction for what the company is doing next.

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-comments-2026-medicare-advantage-star-ratings-and](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-comments-2026-medicare-advantage-star-ratings-and)

“Our technology centric care strategy fortunately puts us in a position where the Star rating does not dominate our results in the way it does for other plans,” said **Andrew Toy, Chief Executive Officer** of Clover Health. “With the year-over-year AI-driven improvements that we see in Clover Assistant and momentum in additional doctors signing up for our platform, we feel our business model can offset any effect from the Star rating. We are built to offer amazing wide-network benefits to our members independent of the rating, and we will drive growth and profitability while doing so.

Through the first half of 2025, which similar to 2027 is a 3.5 Star payment year, Clover grew revenue by 34% and membership by 32% year-over-year while delivering sustained Adjusted EBITDA profitability.”

I know what you are thinking... What the fuck does that even mean motherfucker? (Chris Rock show reference 2:09)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY)

[Please give Moocao Credit for this. IT is his tracker. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6jnpa4sp7uf1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9d9838d0f507237b66d299860d2c20dad23cb1)

The table above provides a breakdown of Medical Care Ratio (MCR) and how much Clover Health is investing in its current cohort of members. This is an important metric because while this spending initially drove the stock price down last quarter, it also lays the foundation for long-term profitability moving into 2026.

Why? Clover’s strategy is to frontload investments in preventive and coordinated care so that members remain healthier and live longer. This is not speculation--this approach was documented and supported in its published white paper. By investing early, Clover can reduce costly hospitalizations and complications over time, which translates into better margins in future years.

As I’ve mentioned in previous posts --and now reinforced by the recent CMS star rating release--several large insurers such as Humana, CVS Health (Aetna), and UnitedHealth Group are pulling back from certain markets.

This retreat is happening because:

* These insurers also lost star ratings, which impacts their quality bonus payments and profitability.
* They are projected to lose money in some counties, particularly in high-cost or underserved regions.
* To stabilize their balance sheets, they are consolidating or exiting those markets.

Clover, on the other hand, is expanding into those very same markets. Its proprietary technology--specifically its CA/Counterpart assistant platform--has shown that in counties with an Area Deprivation Index (ADI) of 7 or lower, implementation can improve health outcomes at scale. I still need to make a post for this, but the news keeps getting in the way.

This is why, even with a 3.5-star rating projected for 2027, Clover still has a strong path for continued growth and expansion. Furthermore, the company will continue to benefit from the 4.0-star quality bonus it receives in 2025–2026, which will help fuel expansion and strengthen financial resilience.

While Clover’s fundamentals and strategy remain sound, what concerns me more is the broader economic climate. I know many pundits on TV say the economy is “doing great,” but what I’m seeing at the ground level tells a different story:

* Rising unemployment
* Stubborn inflation and climbing cost of living
* Public funds shifting away from healthcare and toward ICE and defense--sectors that already command enormous budgets
* Empty supermarkets, shrinking agricultural activity, and job reports that get revised downward, signaling real economic contraction.

By most meaningful measures, we are already in a recession. And this stress will ripple through the healthcare system even if the stock market continues its temporary rally. These conditions create real pressure on both consumers and insurers. Interestingly, history and behavioral economics research offer some insight here. During periods of economic distress, Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollment patterns shift. Many beneficiaries prioritize affordability over star ratings. Lower-rated plans (e.g., 3.0–3.5 stars) may gain enrollment if they offer $0 premiums or lower out-of-pocket costs, even if they don’t have the same bonus-funded benefits as 4+ star plans.

A 3.5-star plan can still provide:

* Low or no monthly premium
* Competitive provider networks
* Key supplemental benefits such as OTC credits, dental/vision coverage, transportation, and gym memberships.

Meanwhile, a 4.5-star plan in the same market might carry a $40–$80 premium. In tight economic conditions, that price difference matters. Because of these dynamics, we should expect fierce competition across the MA landscape in the coming years. The companies that can truly execute operationally and deliver real value at a lower cost will be the ones that survive and even thrive during this economic turbulence. Clover’s strategy of early investment in member health, technological efficiency, and targeted market expansion positions it to compete effectively, even without a 5-star rating. In short: while star ratings matter, cost structure, adaptability, and execution will matter even more in the challenging years ahead. This is especially true when CMS continues to compress the MA plans. I wonder if we will have a 5 stars plan next year.

There’s a puzzling but intriguing question that I’ve been thinking about. Clover Health’s leadership knew months in advance that the company would be hit with a 3.5-star rating, yet they’ve chosen to double down on their strategy rather than pull back. CVS, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare are retreating. Clov is continuing to expand into new insurance markets and investing heavily in scaling their SaaS business through Counterpart, even as other major insurers retreat. This isn’t the behavior of a leadership team that’s unaware or reckless. On the contrary, it suggests they have a strong level of confidence in their growth trajectory despite the temporary loss of star rating bonuses. That leads me to wonder what exactly they’re seeing in the data or regulatory environment that gives them this assurance. It may be tied to their strong clinical performance metrics, particularly their industry-leading HEDIS scores, or possibly to anticipated regulatory tailwinds that favor their model. More likely, it reflects a long-term strategy that views the star rating downgrade as short-term noise rather than a structural threat. Whatever the underlying reason, their willingness to lean in and expand signals they believe they’re well positioned to capture market share in the years ahead.",Rainyfriedtofu,2025-10-10 10:49:03,44,0.96,8,52,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1o2sbio/medicare_advantage_and_part_d_compression/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1o2sbio/medicare_advantage_and_part_d_compression/,self.Healthcare_Anon,0,Due Diligence,,0,none,"[""https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2025-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-star-ratings](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2025-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-star-ratings)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/z75h2rvii7uf1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=006cabb65e62ce992c7286e2826117408bd4aafa"", ""https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-comments-2026-medicare-advantage-star-ratings-and](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-comments-2026-medicare-advantage-star-ratings-and)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/j6jnpa4sp7uf1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9d9838d0f507237b66d299860d2c20dad23cb1)""]",12825,78,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're unfamiliar with my work, you may primarily recognize my weekly updates on institutional activity for a few of the public ADAS stocks. However, I also keep track other indicators that I believe signal upward or downward trends. This report relies solely on data to maintain impartiality towards the featured companies. The companies covered in this report include AEVA (Aeva Technologies), HSAI (Hesai Group), LAZR (Luminar Technologies), LIDR (Aeye Inc), INVZ (Innoviz Technologies), MVIS (Microvision), OUST (Ouster), and VLEEY (Valeo SE – ADR). I gather data from Nasdaq.com and Fintel.io, leveraging information provided by Webull.com. The objective of this report is to evaluate each company on an equitable basis. I've incorporated press releases and announcements to allow readers to understand a specific company's activities during the week or month. Furthermore, the report will include institutional buying and selling behavior data from Fintel, focused on the United States market. Additionally, I will analyze market capitalizations, moving averages, profitability, outstanding shares (OS), average three-month volume, and changes in weekly closes.

1o26205,all,The Power of Human Connection in a Distracted World - CFEC,"# Author: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales in collaboration with Professor Robert Waldinger

What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you could invest in just one thing that would help you and your family thrive, where would you put your time and energy? These questions might seem simple, but their answers hold profound implications for how we live our lives and raise our children. Science gives us a surprisingly clear answer: the quality of our relationships matters more than almost anything else.

The Harvard Study of Adult Development, which began in 1938, represents the longest investigation into adult life ever conducted. Over the decades, these researchers studied every major domain of life: mental health, physical health, work, relationships, and ageing.

After following thousands of people from their teens through their eighties and nineties, examining data from their twenties, thirties, and forties to predict who would stay healthy and live longest, the researchers discovered something remarkable.

The best predictor of who would live a happy, healthy life wasn’t blood pressure. It wasn’t cholesterol levels. It was the quality of their connections with other people. The people who were more connected to others stayed healthier and were happier throughout their lives. And it wasn’t simply about seeing more people each week. It was about having warmer, more meaningful connections. Quality trumped quantity in every measure that mattered.

It makes sense that warmer relationships can make us happier, but how can they also help to protect us from various diseases and health conditions? As other studies began finding the same patterns, scientists started understanding the powerful biological pathways through which human connection influences our health. Much of it relates to stress regulation: good relationships help us to find balance and manage the inevitable stresses of life, preventing them from breaking down our bodies over time.

The implications extend across generations. People who developed strong social and emotional skills in childhood maintained warmer connections with their spouses six decades later, even into their eighties and nineties. This demonstrates that these skills are not only teachable but have remarkably long-lasting effects.

Teaching children to better understand both their inner and outer worlds sets them up for a lifetime of healthier, more fulfilling relationships.

But if connection is the key to human thriving, we face a concerning reality: every social trend is moving in the opposite direction. For the past 70 years, we have been investing less and less in each other. We are less likely to have dinner together as a family – something we know has an enormous impact on child development. We are less likely to have friends over. We are less likely to join clubs and community groups.

Perhaps most troubling of all, more people than ever report having no one they can confide in about what is going on in their life.

We live increasingly lonelier lives, which research shows is toxic to human health, and it’s our young people (aged 16 to 24) that report being the loneliest of all – the very generation that should be forming the relationships that will sustain them throughout life.

While new technology has many benefits, we must also acknowledge that it plays a complex and often troubling role in this epidemic of disconnection. While digital devices promise to keep us connected, they frequently do the opposite. Our smartphones, tablets, and computers have become sources of constant distraction, fragmenting our focus and preventing us from giving others the undivided attention that relationships require. We sit together in the same room while our minds are scattered across dozens of apps, notifications, and feeds. We’re physically present but mentally absent, unable to fully engage with the people right in front of us.

This technological interference strikes at something fundamental: our undivided attention is the most precious gift we can give another person. Yet, increasingly, it’s the most difficult gift to offer. When we check our phones during conversations, scroll through social media during family dinners, or respond to e-mails while playing with our children, we’re not just being distracted, we are withdrawing the basic form of love that human connection requires.

The challenge is particularly acute for today’s babies and young children who have been born into a world immersed in digital technology.

Neuroscience has shown us that early childhood is the golden opportunity to build strong foundations for future life outcomes. Pregnancy to the age of five is the fastest and most profound period of brain development in our lives, with an astonishing 1,000,000 new neural connections being formed every second. The brains of babies and young children are at their most malleable and open to change, as they constantly adapt to their interactions with the outside world.

Children who are raised in environments rooted in love, safety and dignity, are better able to develop the social and emotional scaffolding required to form healthy relationships, resolve conflict and grow into adults capable of building loving partnerships, families and communities themselves.

Ultimately, by nurturing the development of social and emotional skills in early life, we will be equipping children with the capacity to love and be loved. These skills will influence their success far more than academic achievements alone, and will touch every part of their lives, from how they form friendships, to how they raise their own children, to their values and the decisions they make. Honing these skills could be transformative as we look to the future and imagine a very different world.

The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood’s Shaping Us Framework, and series of animated films launched this summer, are designed to showcase the many ways we can support the development of the social and emotional skills in our youngest children. These films can help everyone understand the remarkable value of routine interactions in forming loving relationships. They celebrate the everyday moments of connection, shared in every story, cuddle and whispered word of encouragement.

Providing this kind of nurturing environment is not always easy. It is important to acknowledge that adults are best able to care for a child when they have good social and emotional skills themselves; when they are healthy and have the resources and assistance they need. Those who have experienced significant adversity, including in their own childhoods, may understandably need more support. Likewise, it is a greater challenge for those facing difficult personal circumstances, whether financial, or due to poor health or social isolation. But just as science is confirming the lifelong importance of connections, we exist in a world that is more distracted than ever.

For babies and young children, the pull of screens will be even stronger than for older children and adults, the habits more deeply ingrained as they grow. Yet this is precisely the period when children should start developing the social and emotional skills that will serve them throughout life. We’re raising a generation that may be more “connected” than any in history while simultaneously being more isolated, more lonely, and less equipped to form the warm, meaningful relationships that research tells us are the foundation of a healthy life.

So, what are we to do about these trends driving us away from human connection? The answer begins with recognising that attention is something we can choose to give each other in every moment – at home, at work, in our communities. It requires conscious effort to be fully present with the people we care about. It means protecting sacred spaces for genuine connection: family dinners, conversations, moments of genuine eye contact and engaged listening.

For parents, it means understanding that the foundations for this are laid at a remarkably young age – in fact, before we are even born and in the earliest weeks and months of our lives when our brains undergo the fastest and most profound period of brain development. It means modeling these behaviors for our babies and children and teaching them skills they will need to navigate a world filled with technological distractions.

It means helping them understand that true connection requires presence, that relationships need tending, and that the quality of their connections will shape not just their happiness but their health for decades to come.

These social and emotional skills are teachable, and teaching children to better understand both their inner and outer worlds and how to best manage them sets them up for a lifetime of more loving and more fulfilling relationships. This may be the most important investment we can make in ourselves, our families and in the future of humankind

The evidence is clear: if you could invest in just one thing to help you and your family thrive, invest in the relationships you have with each other.

This is not just about creating a more loving environment for our children. It’s about creating a more loving world. And that begins with a simple, deliberate act.

Look the people you care about in the eye and be fully there – because that is where love begins. For babies and children who are raised in attentive and loving environments are better able to develop the social and emotional skills that will allow them to grow into adults capable of building loving partnerships, families, communities. This is our children’s greatest inheritance.

But most importantly even without the proofing. Just the 30M worth of Solana is enough to put this at 2.0  
even if Crypto crashes the next few days and Solana drops to $5, this would still be worth $1 just from face value. 

anyway I’m holding this long term, I’ve been to SEA, china, Hong Kong etc several times for work. 

This company is doing a similar thing like GLXY, tokenizing stocks which is a HUGE thing, since you can now trade stocks 24/7. This is definitely the first one in Asian countries to do this which is a great start

TLDR: YYAI is a subsidiary of CONEXXA, and is now using YYAI like a SPAC to start an exchange platform via tokenisation. Is this a scam? I don’t think so, theres actually a news report on Nasdaq that they have completed test runs and ready to launch

Tesla has scaled back its ambitious goal of producing thousands of Optimus robots by the end of 2025, with engineers struggling to perfect the hand and forearm designs...Leading to incomplete Optimus bodies, missing critical components, and a temporary halt in mass production.   
  
Initially they were aiming for 5,000 units then Tesla revised the target to 2000 after engineers protested the unrealistic timeline. musk later acknowledged the hand design issues in interviews and on a podcast, and admittied that achieving humanlike dexterity is the toughest challenge, but yet again provided no clear timeline for resolution.  
  
infact earlier this year a former project leader challenged Musk’s vision. Also argued that optimus is not suited for warehouse or manufacturing tasks further talking about the the project’s hurdles.

1o014oj,all,Fossil Fuels & Alberta...,"I am an environmentalist.  We hear a ton about ""Common Sense"" and to me protecting the natural world that our species arises from and that sustains us is the most basic foundational common sense there is...

We are at a point in the climate crisis and overall environmental crisis in which we have world record wildfires around the globe each year, we have ocean acidification so bad that coral bleaching has almost wiped it all out, we are in the Holocene extinction which is the sixth mass extinction of our whole planets history and this time humanity is the asteroid..

We are now 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and for those in the know it's extremely scary to think what comes with 3-4°C....

Also the climate crisis and overall environmental crisis comes with costs and those costs are growing and compounding.  It's going to add a horrific dimension onto the already affordability of life crisis/quality of life crisis.  Crisis points that of course always disproportionately impact the working class and the most vulnerable.

It all feels like the movie ""Don't Look Up"".

I wanted though today to talk not from an environmental or even multidimensional economic perspective but just super super simple one dimensional thinking..

The world is going more and more towards Renewable Energy especially Solar Power, Wind Power, and Battery Technology as they are not just cleaner but cheaper.

In global trends 90%+ of new power capacity was from Renewable Energy sources.

Electric Vehicle market share continues to grow:

When we look at passenger plug-in market share of total new car sales we see that a decade ago a lot of countries were only at around 0.5% to 1% those same countries a decade later are now 30-50%.

Canada itself has went from 0.20% to around 15%.

The average vehicle stays on the road for around 10-15 years.  That means in the next decade there is going to be a huge shift.

The world is advancing further and further in regards to electrification on countless fronts.

Being able to develop new power generation/economic focus points doesn't happen overnight... It takes years to around a decade to build frameworks and a decade to two or three to get new economic focus points.....

Diversifying the economy/energy even outside of climate and environmental concerns means we should be starting ASAP...

It seems like we are doing a lot of extremely short-sighted moves here which are not just going to hurt but potentially devastate countless people and families by the outcomes on the horizon.

Anyway just trying to draw attention because the more awareness/education the more pressure there is for government officials to do the right thing versus corruption/collusion with certain industry interests like we have been seeing.

# 🇩🇪 Exclusive document: How Berlin clinics are being prepared for war against Russia

Germany is preparing hospitals for a possible war with Russia: a confidential Berlin ""Civil Defense"" plan would make 53 hospitals ready to treat wartime casualties—Berlin 100 wounded/day (Germany up to 1,000)—shift to mass/war medicine, prioritize military triage and may force restructurings. Funding gaps, severe staff shortages and talk of reinstating conscription raise fears civilian care could be reduced. *(*[*Berliner Zeitung*](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/exklusives-dokument-so-werden-berliner-kliniken-auf-krieg-vorbereitet-li.2360385)*, 6 minute read, 2025-10-05)*

# 🇩🇪  Ryanair cancels numerous winter connections: BER hit particularly hard

Ryanair will sharply cut its winter schedule across German airports, with January reductions of about 30% overall; Memmingen could lose up to 27 weekly frequencies and Berlin 76 of 246 Ryanair weekly flights. November and December cuts are 4% and 6%. The airline blames high German operating costs amid a dispute over BER rules, including a night flight ban. *(*[*Berliner Zeitung*](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de//news/ryanair-streicht-zahlreiche-winterverbindungen-ber-besonders-hart-getroffen-li.2360640)*, 2 minute read, 2025-10-05)*

# 🇩🇪 Fake police officers and tradesmen prey on defenceless pensioners

Berlin police say investigators recorded seven trick-theft scams this Wednesday targeting elderly residents across Zehlendorf, Charlottenburg, Prenzlauer Berg, Mitte, Wilhelmstadt, Wilmersdorf and Wedding. Perpetrators posed as police, handymen or electricians to distract victims and steal cash, jewelry or bank cards; one suspect posing as a new neighbor fled with money. Authorities urge victims to report incidents and offer safety tips: don’t let strangers in, verify IDs, use door chains/intercoms and involve neighbors. *(*[*B.Z. – Die Stimme Berlins*](https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/falsche-polizisten-handwerker-betrug)*, 3 minute read, 2025-10-05)*

# 🇩🇪 U-Bahn in Berlin: This is why line 2 in the city center is closed for weeks

Berlin’s U2 will be closed between Stadtmitte and Senefelderplatz from 20 Oct–3 Nov 2025 as a new electronic signal box at Alexanderplatz replaces 1980s relay technology; rail replacement buses (which do not stop at every affected U‑station) will run, lengthening journeys. BVG says the upgrade will allow a return to four‑minute headways from Jan 2026. Separate works mean trains toward Pankow won’t stop at Senefelderplatz until 12 Mar 2026. *(*[*MOZ.de*](https://www.moz.de/nachrichten/brandenburg/u-bahn-in-berlin-deshalb-ist-die-linie-2-in-der-innenstadt-wochenlang-gesperrt-78348814.html)*, 3 minute read, 2025-10-03)*

# 🇬🇧 ""Zu verschenken"" crack down

Berlin will raise fines for leaving goods on the street — penalties due in the coming weeks after illegal dumping cost the city about €10.3m last year — putting the capital’s long-standing ""zu verschenken"" free‑giveaway culture at risk. Fines range from €150–€300 for clothes to up to €15,000 for appliances. Officials cite cleanup costs and offer formal disposal options; advocates warn enforcement is impractical and may send reusable items to landfill. *(*[*DW*](https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-to-crack-down-on-a-beloved-giveaway-tradition/a-74201577)*, 6 minute read, 2025-10-03)*

# 🇬🇧 Germany arrests suspected Hamas members accused of procuring weapons to target Jewish or Israeli institutions

German police arrested three suspected Hamas members in Berlin accused of procuring firearms ""for assassinations targeting Israeli or Jewish institutions,"" prosecutors said Wednesday; they face charges of membership in a foreign terrorist organization and preparing an act of violence endangering the state and will appear before a judge Thursday. Authorities—two German nationals and one Lebanon-born—seized an AK‑47, pistols and significant ammunition; Hamas denied ties. *(*[*CNN*](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/01/europe/hamas-germany-arrests-israel-latam-intl)*, 1 minute read, 2025-10-01)*

# 🇩🇪 New rent review body finds extortionate rents in almost two-thirds of cases

Berlin’s rent‑review office, set up by the Senate this spring, checked 255 leases over six months and found excessive rents in 177 of 190 closed cases (≈93%), often charged by large housing companies. Most complaints came from Mitte and Friedrichshain‑Kreuzberg and from young or migrant tenants. Officials say enforcement powers are limited; critics demand stronger laws and systematic market monitoring. *(*[*rbb24*](https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/10/berlin-mietwucher-wohnen-mietpreispruefstelle.html)*, 3 minute read, 2025-10-01)*

# 🇩🇪 Berlin: Vietnamese trainees disappeared from schools

Hundreds of Vietnamese apprentices have vanished from Berlin vocational schools—about one-third of roughly 700 students at Brillat‑Savarin School in Weißensee are unaccounted for, RBB reports—raising fears they slipped into illegal work or prostitution. Teachers say many barely speak German despite required certificates and schools are strained. Nationwide, about 16,000 Vietnamese trainees (≈2,000 in Berlin) face high recruitment fees, debt and risk of exploitation by organised criminal networks. *(*[*B.Z. – Die Stimme Berlins*](https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/vietnamesische-azubis-vermisst)*, 2 minute read, 2025-10-01)*

# 🇩🇪 Surveillance AI in public spaces: Senate wants to test new technology in Berlin

Berlin will trial a surveillance AI that analyzes passersby’s behavior in public, the Senate confirmed at an interior committee hearing; the system—already used in Mannheim and Hamburg—would scan movements and flag unusual patterns in real time. Timing and locations remain undecided as legal and operational rules are reviewed; authorities cite public‑safety benefits, while critics warn of privacy and data‑protection risks. *(*[*Berliner Zeitung*](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/berliner-senat-plant-einfuehrung-von-ueberwachungs-ki-im-oeffentlichen-raum-li.2360097)*, 2 minute read, 2025-09-30)*

# 🇩🇪 Several injured in streetcar accident at Alexanderplatz

At midday near Berlin’s Alexanderplatz a Danish coach turning across tracks collided with a tram on Mollstraße, derailing the tram and destroying both vehicles; the bus driver was severely injured and taken to hospital, and at least five tram passengers—including schoolchildren aboard—sustained minor injuries. The crash damaged a power mast, cutting tram power to a wider area; about 30 people were treated and 60 firefighters are on scene to re-rail and clear the site. *(*[*STERN.de*](https://www.stern.de/panorama/weltgeschehen/alexanderplatz-berlin--strassenbahn-kracht-mit-reisebus-zusammen-36093922.html)*, 2 minute read, 2025-09-30)*

# 🇩🇪 43 million tons: What the huge lithium deposit in Saxony-Anhalt means

Neptune Energy says a summer pilot found an estimated 43 million tonnes lithium‑carbonate equivalent in the Altmark (northern Saxony‑Anhalt), potentially easing German and European battery supply. The long‑time gas producer is expanding lithium pilots as it shifts focus, but projects face local resistance over environmental risks, and other German regions are also being explored. *(*[*t3n*](https://t3n.de/news/43-millionen-tonnen-was-das-riesige-lithium-vorkommen-in-sachsen-anhalt-bedeutet-1709858/)*, 2 minute read, 2025-09-29)*

# 🇩🇪 ""No sudden increase in cannabis consumption""

An interim evaluation presented Monday in Berlin by researchers from Hamburg‑Eppendorf, Düsseldorf and Tübingen finds Germany’s partial cannabis legalization (effective 1 Apr 2024) has not triggered a surge in use or major health harms: youth use fell, adult use followed existing trends, cannabis crimes dropped 60–80% and black‑market purchases declined; no urgent legal changes recommended, but further study needed. *(*[*LTO.de*](https://www.lto.de/recht/nachrichten/n/cannabis-zwischenbericht-teillegalisierung-veroeffentlicht-evaluierung)*, 5 minute read, 2025-09-29)*

# 🇩🇪 Police looking for suspected perpetrator after fire with two fatalities in Berlin-Marzahn

After a nighttime fire in a duplex in Berlin‑Marzahn that left two people dead, police are searching for two residents and suspect one of causing the blaze based on witness statements; prosecutors have opened murder and attempted‑murder investigations. The house, rented to eight workers, yielded two bodies and four survivors (two seriously, one life‑threatened); autopsy and forensic details remain undisclosed. *(*[*rbb24*](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/09/feuer-berlin-marzahn-einsatzkraefte-zwei-leichen-suche-taeter.html)*, 2 minute read, 2025-09-29)*

1o2wdr8,all,Thoughts as an anti,"I am pretty staunchly anti-ai. Apologies for the length. I've been watching this subreddit for a while, and I can't really say I like the general vibe. As a whole, this sub feels hostile to anti-ai folk, with increasingly more posts being divided into either open antagonism or enlightened centrism, and many arguments (on both sides) commit strawman and composition fallacies. I don't want to belabor this point though, as this has already been brought up plenty, and I do want to admit that the *rare* valuable discussion that occurs has helped me develop my views. I'll mostly be writing this for myself as a sort of checkpoint in thought, and if it generates any discussion, all the better.

## AI art is art

I will not argue that AI output cannot be considered art. Art is a pretty loaded term that can seem to mean something aesthetically appealing, a form of expression, both, something in between, or something else entirely. I somewhat subscribe to the ""artworld"" type approach, where Duchamp's *Fountain* is considered art, in which case I must also consider *Théâtre D'opéra Spatial* art. Internally I may judge AI art as ""lesser"", just as many of us judge and compare different works, but it may still be art nevertheless.

The designation of ""artist"" still puzzles me. I'm not a fan of semantic arguments, but words are communication and hold meaning, so not agreeing on some general definition can break down communication. If I hear at Thanksgiving that recently my cousin has been making a living as an artist, and I eventually find out they've only been generating AI art with basic prompting, I would feel a bit deceived. My stance is many AI artists don't seem to fall under the umbrella of artist for me at the moment due to the consensus definition within my vicinity, but this definition may shift to encompass them as culture changes. 

## AI art is (probably) theft

I have a decent idea of the mechanics of these models (graduate level computer science degree), so I don't think it's completely accurate to say they are making carbon copies or even collages of existing works. The nonconsensual use of artist IPs in training the models is a bit more of a grey area for me. While certainly abused, I do think there is merit in the existence of the copyright of an IP. When artists posted their work online, it was meant to be seen and shared, I don't think we should fault them for not anticipating it may be used to train a model (even if TOS permits it, please admit no one reads it). To some extent, I can concede that there is possibly ""fair use"" of the materials. 

However, I feel like the line is a bit less blurry when addressing the deliberate training and use of AI to directly replicate an artist's IP/likeness. IP laws exist to incentivize creative work and allow for proper attribution, and I hope most can agree that this type of deliberate infringement goes against these goals. While this is one way AI art can harm artists, I think it's also worth mentioning the harm caused through the theft of jobs. I don't want to sound too accusatory, but I can't help but feel that many responses to this point seem to lack empathy for artists who refuse to ""adapt"". Some artists may have spent their whole life specializing in their trade, and refuse to use new technologies as it would conflict with their personal morals. Was this inevitable? Maybe. Is it still bad? Yes, for those affected. 

## I feel AI art is harmful

My main gripe with AI art is the consequences it has had on the broad art landscape. AI is ""just a tool"" the same way a gun is ""just a tool"". This argument avoids the nuances of AI that distinguishes from all the other so called ""tools"". In essence, AI image generation has greatly accelerated the pace at which passable to high quality images are created. Left unopposed, this creates a flood of content, which is clearly evident in many social networks. While the ""contentification"" of the web was already underway, AI has certainly accelerated this process. As art is dragged along in this trend, I worry that we increasingly divorce content from context. 

When I and many others figure out something is AI generated, it signals ""low effort"". As AI gets more and more distinguishable, on average I fear we begin to attribute less and less to the process, seeing art more as it simply presents itself. No, traditional art will not die, but there certainly has been a chilling effect on the traditional arts. Is this just the natural evolution of culture? Probably, but I can't help but feel like something very human and meaningful is lost along the way. The same way I've grown up with digital communication replacing much of face-to-face communication, I simply worry of the consequences indifference to AI vs. non-AI art will lead.

## Conclusion

I do not like AI art, but my position has mostly rested largely on my own personal feelings. I can accept that AI can be used in the process of creating art, but I would generally prefer it not to be. If you choose to create AI art, I will likely disapprove, but who are you to care what I think.",Origamijr,2025-10-10 15:07:52,33,0.9,72,105,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/aiwars/comments/1o2wdr8/thoughts_as_an_anti/,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1o2wdr8/thoughts_as_an_anti/,self.aiwars,0,,,0,none,[],5107,19,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

***Editor’s Note:*** *This is high-level analysis from my couch at 6:45 AM on a Saturday.*

*I’m not defending a graduate thesis or getting into specific presidential decisions.*

*This is a 30,000-foot view for anyone trying to understand what the hell is happening between America and China. There might be some omissions, but they don’t change the trajectory. I’m giving you the big picture patterns that led us here.*





Dear Fellow Traveler,

The headlines sound like economic warfare…

***Reuters:*** \*“\***China expands rare earths restrictions, targets defense and chips users”**

***New York Times:*** “**Trump says he’ll impose new 100% tariff on China ‘over and above’ current rates, massively escalating trade war”**

But somewhere in Beijing, a Chinese official is probably thinking…

**“Took you long enough to notice.”**

[***The Capital Wars***](https://capitalwars.substack.com/) between the United States and China have now shifted into a new phase… one that could not just drag the U.S. markets lower, and also drastically impact our national security and economic stability…

The U.S. response to this @#$% show for now?

Headlines like this…

https://preview.redd.it/x60a9evevhuf1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebad3c8ee49fb068b56d1c2b7c110792e6e8dc1

Oh… Now’s the time? After Friday’s selloff?

\[***Sidenote:*** If that’s the case… when, why the hell was Jim Cramer recommending DraftKings (DKNG), [**a speculative stock with little earnings**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/jim-cramer-buy-draftkings-now.html), last Friday? Thanks, bud.\]

**Let’s step back on China and the United States…**

This blowup didn’t start last week or last decade. Historical disasters brew for years through accumulating pressures that seem manageable until they suddenly aren’t.

Small policy decisions compound over time into existential threats, like the 2008 crisis that began with reasonable 1980s deregulation decisions, or how World War I started with decades of accumulated tensions that one assassination finally triggered.

This is the story of how America chose finance while China chose steel…

And why that difference now threatens everything.

# The Fork in the Road: 2008

Yes, a lot happened before 2008.

In 2006, China announced absolute [**state control of seven industries**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/postcards-he-who-rules-the-seas-part-70a) (two months after the U.S. midterm elections).

They were shipping armaments, power generation/distribution, oil and chemicals, telecommunications, coal, and aviation. You know… tangible assets. This would set the tone for what came next…

After the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, both countries had to choose their economic futures.

It was like a fork in the road, except the American path led to a casino and the Chinese path led to a steel mill.

When Lehman Brothers collapsed, America’s response was swift.. The government chose to reflate the financial system at any cost. [**That’s been the pattern ever since.**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/the-1-pattern-aka-the-one-weird-trick)

The Federal Reserve slashed rates to zero and pumped trillions into markets through quantitative easing (QE).

It worked brilliantly for Wall Street.

Everyone else? Well…

The S&P 500 tripled from its 2009 lows. But money flowed into financial assets instead of productive investments. [**It’s a reminder that incentives matter…**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/oh-great-here-comes-larry-summers-436)

Companies found it cheaper to buy back stock than build factories.

Entrepreneurs focused on apps instead of steel. Investors put money into triple-leveraged ETFs instead of a new factory that might create jobs and generate a steady 8% annual return…

America became incredibly good at moving money around while becoming dependent on other countries for manufacturing goods. We maintained leadership in technology and high-end services, but our production capacity steadily eroded.

***We mastered getting rich by shuffling paper around… while forgetting how to make the paper.***

By 2020, the U.S. economy leaned heavily on services and finance, with manufacturing accounting for around 10% to 11% GDP, while the broader FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) category was near 20 percent.

We’ve endured, for 17 years since the crisis, complete financialization.

We saw “wealth” grow through financial engineering rather than producing goods people actually need.

And even then, it’s all largely been a mirage…

An illusion… thanks to currency debasement in the process.

https://preview.redd.it/pizcn9yivhuf1.jpg?width=1592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac1c66a76dd5bf87f962d75381327b74e041fbf8

On a ratio basis, the S&P 500 has given back a large chunk of its 2000 outperformance versus gold.

The S&P-to-gold ratio is now a fraction of its 2000 peak.

Hey Jerome Powell… take a lap, bud.

# China’s Choice: The Materials Path

China looked at 2008 and drew opposite conclusions.

While America was making money from money,

China doubled down on its industrial policies.

Beijing launched massive infrastructure projects and systematically targeted industries it wanted to dominate. The “Made in China 2025” plan wasn’t subtle…

The goal was to control 70% of advanced materials markets, dominate renewable energy, lead in AI and robotics, and secure semiconductor supply chains.

State banks provided cheap loans.

The government offered subsidies and guaranteed purchases.

Local officials were rewarded for industrial targets, not stock performance.

While America mastered moving money, China mastered moving materials.

It turns out you can’t eat a derivative or drive a credit default swap…

China’s strategy was part of something bigger… U.S. policymakers have been fighting over power for three decades with a bloodlust, missing the broader picture and how quickly the world has changed in less than two decades.

Since 2008, the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have increased control over raw materials that make civilization possible.

While America celebrated the “knowledge economy,” these countries procured everything you need to actually live:

BRICS countries hold critical positions in materials that make modern life possible.

South Africa and Russia dominate platinum-group metals, Brazil is a giant in iron ore and agriculture, and China controls most rare-earth processing and a large share of battery inputs. India has significant mineral potential and is expanding its reserves through international partnerships and domestic exploration.

Some of these places are politically unstable… but they still have the resources…

Combined, BRICS controls physical inputs for everything from smartphones to fighter jets.

# China’s Systematic Industrial Takeover: The Blueprint

China’s dominance didn’t happen by accident.

They followed a methodical pattern, and American policymakers spent infinitely more time on wealth transfers and subsidies...

Take shipbuilding… seemingly boring but strategically crucial. It’s utterly impossible to [**build ships in the United States anymore.**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/postcards-he-who-rules-the-seas-part) That’s been an issue for decades.

By the 1990s, South Korea and Japan dominated global shipbuilding.

China was building mostly dinghies. But Beijing identified shipbuilding as strategic.

They knew that ships carry 90% of global trade, require advanced steel and engineering, and create spillover benefits.

China’s approach was patient.

State banks provided cheap loans, and the government guaranteed orders from state-owned shipping companies. Foreign builders had to transfer technology for market access, while local governments provided subsidized infrastructure.

By 2020, China was building 40% of global shipping capacity while former competitors wondered what the hell happened.

China delivered roughly 53% of global shipyard output in 2024 and controls a majority of the orderbook. It was like watching your quiet neighbor gradually take over the entire block while you were day-trading.

This exact playbook was applied systematically across many industries…

China today controls:

* 60% of global steel production
* 70% of solar panel manufacturing
* 77% of lithium battery production
* 90% of rare earth processing

Each industry followed the same pattern.

They identified strategic importance, flooded the sector with state capital, undercut competitors, dominated the market, and controlled entire supply chains.

[**So basically… Amazon… but at the sovereign level…**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/amazon-amzn-digital-feudalism-as)

# And Now Raw Materials

Now… why is the rare earth story so important?

China doesn’t just mine rare earths…

They built the entire ecosystem around them.

Raw neodymium from Africa gets processed in China into magnets, assembled into motors, and installed in wind turbines.

China exports globally.

This vertical integration means even countries with mineral deposits depend on Chinese processing.

You might own the mine, but China controls everything from raw ore to finished products.

It’s like owning a cow but having to send the milk to China to get cheese.

America’s financial dominance worked for decades because everyone had to play by U.S. rules.

Need oil? Use dollars.

Want capital markets? Come to Wall Street.

It was like being the only casino in town.

But 2008 and 2020 exposed the risks.

When American banks froze, credit dried up everywhere.

When the Fed printed trillions, commodity prices spiked globally.

Countries realized dependence on American financial systems meant their economies could be destroyed by American mistakes they couldn’t control.

BRICS nations started asking…

*Why should we depend on a system that prioritizes America’s needs?*

They began trading in their own currencies, created alternative development banks, and launched the Belt and Road Initiative.

These were seeds of a multipolar world where Washington wouldn’t call every shot.

# The Crisis Warning Signs

The crisis warning signs were everywhere, but seemed manageable individually:

1. **Trade Imbalances:** U.S.-China deficit grew from $84 billion (2000) to over $ 350 billion (2016). We sent dollars, they sent everything else. It was basically the world’s most expensive subscription service.
2. **Technology Transfer:** American companies agreed to joint ventures and tech sharing for market access. That hasn’t paid off. It’s been like teaching someone poker while they pick your pocket.
3. **Supply Chain Dependence:** Companies moved production to China for lower costs. Everyone celebrated “efficiency” while building a house of cards. Now, we don’t make anything in America anymore. We reach into the next person’s pocket… to quote the show *The Wire*.
4. **Industrial Hollowing:** Manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million (1979) to 12.8 million (2010). We forgot how to make things while celebrating the “service economy.” And what’s worse… no one has benefits or a pension anymore, while they work for the feudalistic tech companies as contractors. [**Thanks, Congress.**](https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/amazon-amzn-digital-feudalism-as)
5. **Financial Sector Growth:** Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate grew from 12% to 20% of GDP. We became middlemen selling services while importing everything we needed. Everything is financialized. Our best engineers build ETFs instead of bridges… and the more we keep going in that direction, the more learning loss we will face. It’s insane that we aren’t stopping the hollowing out of our economy while accelerating national security risks and failing younger generations.

# When a Trade War Became a Tech War

By 2016, policymakers realized China wasn’t just cheap manufacturing - it was a technological competitor challenging U.S. dominance in semiconductors, AI, renewable energy, and advanced materials.

The 2018 tariffs began a new approach, but something significant happened…

It shifted from being about trade to being about technological control, like starting an argument about dishes and ending up in a nuclear standoff over who controls the kitchen.

America banned semiconductor exports to Chinese companies, pressured allies to exclude Chinese 5G equipment, and restricted AI access. China tightened materials controls, restricted gallium and germanium exports, and stockpiled rare earths.

Administrations doubled down with the CHIPS Act and export controls. Trade disputes became technological warfare over industries defining the 21st century.

China’s new rare earth export controls represent a significant escalation.

These 17 metallic elements make modern technology possible: neodymium for EV motors, europium for LED screens, terbium for lasers, and dysprosium for extreme-heat magnets.

China’s new rules resemble the U.S. “foreign direct product” approach in chips, creating a symmetrical escalation where both sides use export controls as strategic weapons.

**China dominates every processing step.** Even rare earths mined elsewhere get shipped to China for refining.

It’s like owning all the flour mills in a world full of bakers.

The controls potentially extend to any product made anywhere using Chinese materials or processing technology. China could restrict exports of EV components made in Mexico, wind turbines made in Europe, or defense equipment made by allies.

[**That’s what you call a chokepoint.**](https://substack.com/home/post/p-175762002?source=queue)

# America’s Remaining Leverage

America still dominates systems, making the global economy function. This includes:

* **Financial infrastructure:** Dollar transactions, SWIFT, correspondent banking
* **Advanced semiconductors**: Nvidia, Intel, AMD design the most sophisticated chips
* **Software platforms**: Operating systems and cloud services running digital infrastructure
* **Military technology:** Our defense systems remain the global gold standard

Trump’s 100% tariff threat also uses America’s $430 billion import market as leverage. But tariffs are blunt instruments that raise consumer costs while accelerating China’s search for alternative markets.

Mexico passed China as America’s top goods supplier in 2023, which shows the supply-chain rethink is real, but China's exposure remains large.

# The Real Stakes: Control of the Future

This is about technological dominance in industries defining the next century…

The big investments and big trends… they’re all on the table. They include:

* **Artificial Intelligence:** This requires advanced semiconductors. America’s chip control means AI control and military superiority… for now...
* **Clean Energy:** It depends on materials that China largely controls. Going green means going through Beijing… again, a massive chokepoint, and something that people in Congress don’t seem to understand.
* **Military Systems:** Modern defense involves networks of sensors, computers, and communications. All require materials related to this conflict. That’s the problem.
* **Politics:** American politics made “China skepticism” a bipartisan issue. Yes, being “tough on China” polls well, but it would take years to reshore manufacturing and even longer for voters to see the benefits. Politicians would beat each other up, lawyers would hold things up, and Americans - who just want to work - would start throwing up their hands.

Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership needs export growth for employment and stability, but also faces domestic pressure to show strength against American pressure. Failure to achieve could put pressure on the Communist Party.

Both sides painted themselves into corners where backing down looks weak.

This isn’t just trade disputes - it’s a new global rivalry defined by supply chains and technological standards rather than military bases.

America emphasizes innovation, financial markets, and alliance networks.

China emphasizes state planning, industrial capacity, and materials control.

These are fundamentally incompatible approaches that will determine the next century’s rules.

# The Money Printer’s Role

America’s financialization was enabled by printing the world’s reserve currency.

When you create money everyone needs, you can trade deficits indefinitely, import goods while exporting dollars, and maintain living standards despite declining production.

But this only works if everyone accepts your currency. BRICS payment alternatives, commodity currencies, and Bitcoin adoption could end the money printing advantage.

China’s resource controls directly challenge dollar dominance. Countries controlling physical materials may have more leverage than those controlling financial systems.

The money printer created conditions for this disaster.

Easy money encouraged financialization over production, consumption over savings, and financial engineering over industrial capacity.

We got drunk on cheap money and forgot how to make things.

Seriously… how many people in this nation can even build a birdhouse?

# What Now…

Assuming this spat goes on for a while, Americans will see higher costs for electronics, EVs, and solar panels.

There should be expected economic volatility for companies exposed to China.

Then, there might be potential manufacturing job creation, but it requires significant training.

All the while, people will continue to bet on printed money outcomes, with some clearly having informational advantages over others. Consider this story below, where someone just made $88 million betting against Bitcoin 30 minutes before Trump’s announcement yesterday… It would be awesome if our regulators and our media investigated these stories… but they won’t…

https://preview.redd.it/xngqfprlvhuf1.jpg?width=590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13b18d6eb4a1a50b4e3d06ff6ae7c68c207d65dd

I digress…

The most serious issue is the national security implications if we remain dependent on Chinese supply chains for critical technologies.

This represents decades of accumulated strategic choices reaching a tipping point.

America chose finance over manufacturing, and consumption over production.

China chose the opposite.

The technologies being fought over… AI, clean energy, advanced materials, and quantum computing… will determine which countries prosper for the next century.

The money printer won’t save us.

You can’t print semiconductors, rare earths, or industrial capacity.

These require a patient, systematic building of real economic power, which America abandoned for financial engineering.

We need more farms… more food… a complete rethinking of things… in a nation of people who probably don’t want to do the work… or worse… lack the knowledge…

Stay positive,

Garrett Baldwin

* RARE EARTHS CONTINUE TO BE A MASSIVE PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. 
* JPMorgan is launching a $1.5 trillion financing initiative over the next decade to back industries vital to U.S. national security and economic independence.
* IONQ - Said it achieved a breakthrough in quantum chemistry, showing its system can calculate atomic-level forces more accurately than classical methods.The study, done with a Global 1000 automaker, used IonQ’s QC-AFQMC algorithm to model nuclear forces for carbon-capture material design. 
* BE - Brookfield and Bloom Energy announced a $5 billion partnership to build global AI infrastructure facilities, with Bloom Energy serving as the preferred onsite power provider for Brookfield’s new AI factories.The deal marks Brookfield’s first investment under its AI Infrastructure strategy and will use Bloom’s fuel cell technology to power data centers requiring massive, always-on electricity capacity.

TXN -BofA downgrades to Underperform from neutral, lowers PT to 190 from 208. This downgrade report is in conjunction with our reassessment of our coverage cluster based on expected upside to our 12-month price objectives. While we continue to appreciate the high quality of TXN’s assets and its execution consistency, we believe the turmoil caused by global tariffs could limit any near- to medium-term demand improvement in the industrial economy.
* INTC - BofA downgrades INTC to underperform from neutral, maintains PT at 34.  We fundamentally disagree with valuation methods that rely on a sum-of-parts approach — applying P/E to INTC Products and P/S to INTC’s loss-making ‘Foundry’. The term ‘foundry’ is a misnomer since it implies great future potential to attract external customers, which we believe is unjustified. INTC relies on TSMC for approximately 30% of its manufacturing, with uncertainty about the cost and yield of its upcoming 18A process and future 14A process. Additionally, we believe U.S. government intervention requires INTC to remain committed to manufacturing, regardless of its profitability. All in, we believe INTC valuation should be based on P/E or EBITDA on earnings generated by the entire company, since there is no catalyst to split
* BofA gave coverage across the semi sector, upgrading AMAT, CAMT to buy, downgraded INTC and ACLS. 
* SFM - RBC capital upgrades to outperform from sector perform, lowers PT to 148 from 176. Since hitting a peak in June, SFM shares are down about 42%, underperforming grocery peers by roughly 31% and the market by about 54% over that period. With shares now trading at around 9x our 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate (\~15x P/E), we believe a comp deceleration on tough comparisons is already priced in, and concerns over recent promotional activity are overblown — creating a favorable risk/reward setup.
* JEF - defended its exposure to bankrupt auto-parts maker First Brands, saying potential losses are “manageable” and don’t threaten its financial health.
* CVLT - Piper Sandler upgrade sto overweight from Neutral, raises PT to 200 from 195. We are upgrading shares of CVLT from Neutral to Overweight and raising our price target to $200, following our recent checks, the recent pullback in shares over the last few weeks, and inputs gathered over the last few months across the space and Commvault specifically.  Overall, Commvault is a Generation-Z player in the backup and recovery space that is seeing durable demand trends given the shift away from the needs of the 'Modern Age.' Commvault is benefiting as its platform can address all of these new-generation needs in a flexible manner across consumption models.
* PYPL - Goldman Downgrades to Sell from neutral, sets PT at 70. We are downgrading shares of PYPL to Sell with a $70 price target. We believe PYPL faces several Transaction Margin headwinds next year, including: 1) continued interest rate headwinds; 2) lapping of the reacceleration of their credit products; and 3) the lapping of targeted repricing benefits in Braintree. Additionally, we see less line of sight for branded checkout re-acceleration in the near term given softer trends in Germany, tariff/de minimis-related disruptions in the U.S., and ongoing competition versus competing wallet form factors.  DATA CENTER NAMES: By 2030, U.S. AI data centers could use nearly 12% of America’s total power, up from just 3.7% in 2023, according to McKinsey.  That’s triple the share in 7 years, roughly 606 terawatt-hours of electricity, almost twice what the entire UK used in 2023.
* TSMC - TSMC keeps extending its lead. Its foundry market share has climbed from 63% in Q1 2024 to 71% in Q2 2025, while Samsung has slipped from 11% to 8%, according to Counterpoint. 
* PANW - Palo Alto Networks upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BTIG PT $248

* Elon Musk’s xAI is developing “world models,” advanced AI systems designed to understand and create physical environments, a step beyond text-based large language models like ChatGPT and Grok, per Financial Times.  To build them, xAI has hired former Nvidia specialists including Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, both with expertise in world modeling. The company plans to first apply the technology to gaming, using it to automatically generate interactive 3D environments, before expanding to robotics applications.  President Trump said he’s directing the Defense Department to use available funds to ensure U.S. troops receive their Oct. 15 paychecks despite the ongoing government shutdown.

*Directions 2050 plan will evaluate long-term transportation needs and identify opportunities to prepare for the next 25 years of growth*

ORANGE – The Orange County Transportation Authority is preparing for the future of transportation throughout Orange County and invites residents, workers, and community leaders to help shape the long-range vision through the development of Directions 2050.

Every four years, OCTA updates its Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), which evaluates how Orange County’s population, economy, and travel demands will evolve over the next two decades and beyond. Directions 2050 will look ahead to the year 2050 and outline strategies to ensure that the county’s transportation system remains efficient, safe, balanced, and sustainable.

“The Long-Range Transportation Plan will help us prepare for Orange County’s future mobility needs by assessing growth trends and identifying the best ways to invest in our transportation network,” said OCTA Chair Doug Chaffee, also the Chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and Fourth District Supervisor. “We want to hear directly from those who use our roads, buses, trains, and bikeways every day to help shape a vision that serves our entire county.”

# Opportunities for Public Input

Community feedback is essential to ensure the plan reflects the needs of Orange County residents. Opportunities to participate include:

* **OCTA LRTP Zoom Webinar** **Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025** 6 to 7 p.m. (Also simulcast in Spanish and Vietnamese) **Registration Link:** [LRTP-Meeting.com](https://lrtp-meeting.com/) **Webinar ID:** 874 9182 4606 **Call-in:** 213-338-8477
* **Online Survey**, available through Nov. 9 at [octa.net/LRTP](https://octa.net/lrtp). (Survey participants will be entered for a chance to win one of four $50 gift cards.)

Directions 2050 will serve as a roadmap for Orange County’s transportation investments, addressing long-term challenges such as population growth, emerging technologies, climate resilience, and sustainable travel options.

The plan will continue to be developed through 2026 and is scheduled to go before the OCTA Board of Directors for consideration before being submitted to the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) for inclusion in the regional transportation plan.

1o5fury,all,Pixel art made a comeback… so why not vector graphics?,"I’ve noticed that over the past ten years, old trends have been coming back; in fashion, like the wide 501 Levi’s jeans, in TV shows and movies that try to capture the atmosphere of the 80s, like Stranger Things, for example, and many others. Well…the same thing is happening in gaming, where pixel art has recently become especially popular, and more and more games are paying homage to old titles by using this retro style. But if old trends are returning, I’m wondering, why isn’t vector arcade game graphics making a comeback like pixel art is?

Honestly, just writing about this topic fills me with nostalgia when I think of old games like Red Baron (1980), Star Wars (1983), and others I used to live for back in the day. While I’m typing this, I can literally hear “Use the Force, Luke” in my head 😂. And honestly, I’m surprised that almost no one has made a proper homage to games like these. Sure, there are a few indie titles like Asteroids Recharged which is actually a tribute to the original Asteroids (1979), and some that are yet to come like Sheva for example. But objectively, there just aren’t any vector style games anymore. That visual style is completely dead. And I know some people associate System Shock with vector style visuals, but let’s be real, it’s not. Yes, it has a somewhat similar color palette that evokes that feeling, but visually, it has nothing to do with it.

Personally, I’d love to see a modern game done in that style, and I think it would be really cool especially with today’s technology, to see what skilled game designers could create with that kind of aesthetic.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this topic.

1nzbpg7,all,For those who think this 80 year old man is crazy about a nvda / nlst deal read below ! The two companies forming a joint venture or actuation by nvda makes perfect sense and allows nvda to create  hybird  chips  that will also create future demand and beat apple intc attempt . Buy nlst,"Hybrid memory modules are poised to revolutionize the way computers handle data. These modules combine different types of memory to optimize performance and efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional memory systems. Here are some key trends 

Unified memory, where both the CPU and GPU share the same memory pool, is becoming more common. This architecture reduces the need for data copying between different memory spaces, leading to faster and more efficient performance.

Apple's M1 chips have popularized this approach, and it is expected to be adopted by other manufacturers. ""Apple has been using a similar memory architecture on iPhones/iPads/iPods for years now, and just introduced this to Macs starting with the M1 APU.""

Lisa sue at AMD built an x86 unified memory solution on their Bulldozer line. Google hUMA and Kaveri.""

Placing memory directly on the CPU or GPU package can significantly reduce latency and increase bandwidth. This is particularly useful for high-performance applications and AI workloads.

High Bandwidth Memory (HBM): HBM is often used in high-end GPUs and is now being considered for CPU integration. ""Intel will be doing something similar on the next generation Xeons by using HBM2 on package as a L4 cache.""

Hybrid Memory Modules: These modules combine different types of memory, such as DRAM and HBM, to balance cost and performance. ""This patent solves the problem by separating memory into multiple banks, one for storing a lot of numbers that are infrequently used, and one for storing a few numbers that are frequently used.""

Upgradability
While soldered memory can improve performance and reduce costs, it also limits upgradability. This is a trade-off that many users are critical of.

 However if you want Faster performance, lower costs, and more efficient use of space. ""The benefit of directly soldered memory to the mainboard is you don’t have to worry about matching pairs of sticks to get the rated speed.""


 I realize the negative for the customer but not for nvda or nlst is Limited or no ability to upgrade, which can be a significant issue for long-term use unless you replace the hybird chip with the new technology . Continue to sell chips after all  !! 

 Tmc can design these hybird chips to be remove znd plug and play !! 

To accomplish 
Increased Capacity and Speed: Future memory modules are expected to offer higher capacities and faster speeds, driven by the demands of AI and other data-intensive applications. ""Apple Silicon processors sport truly ridiculous memory bandwidth of up to 400 GB/s (M3 Max).""   You can’t drive a Lamborghini or Ferrari at full speed in school zones! However these 
Hybrid Designs Combining different types of memory into a single module is likely to become more common to optimize for different use cases. ""We could see a hybrid setup where ARM cores handle basic tasks and x86 cores kick in for more demanding applications.""

Direct integration of memory with GPUs is expected to improve performance, especially for AI and machine learning tasks. "" 
    
 All you experts out there tell me why it’s a good or bad idea to combine  net lists hbm with Nvda Blackwell chips or new chip and make it remove replace and play  by tsm design ! 

Please tell the rpm why I am right ir wrong in my thinking . 

 I truly believe Nvda jv or buying nlst is a no brainer !!  If I was still working I would be at their doors with this idea .

1o51oiv,all,From a non-IT postdoc to an AI developer: my 10-year journey learning to code,"The story is about 10 years old now from today. Well before the GPT era!  
I was stuck in a postdoc role for quite some time. I was fortunate to have a good postdoctoral advisor who was also my mentor.

# Short story:

Postdoc couldn’t get a job → coding seems impossible → “I will never be able to code” → learned R, SQL, basic statistics → 1 year later → got hired as entry-level analyst → 18-hour workdays + no weekends → learned Python → learned machine learning theory, scikit-learn → 2 more years go by → learned neural networks in deep learning → 5 years go by → coding feels so easy now! --> working in AI development

# Long story

I was really interested in the research I was doing related to the field of biology and engineering. I was hoping after all the publications, I would one day have my research group. But life sometimes works in unexpected ways! I never heard back from any department after I applied for Assistant Professor roles. I think one main reason could be that I didn't have any funding/grant.

At any rate, time went by, I started applying in the industry in my area of work. At that time, the only roles I got interviewed for were laboratory technician. It was good that I could do actual experiments in lab and work with fancy instruments but I wanted to do something more. That is when I started thinking out of the box and wondered: *what if I could get into IT?* What would it take? Would I be eligible? What value could I bring in an IT role?

That is when I started looking at job descriptions for positions related to biology but in the IT department in industry. And that was when I met the first “monster”: **coding.**

I had no idea how to code. Instant failure?! It was frustrating times. Felt like I had to give up all that I studied/researched for years. It was all for nothing. And now restart career again from scratch into the unknown world of IT.

Most friends said I was out of my mind to give up everything I had built so far and start fresh in a new discipline. Others said I could give it a try but were highly skeptical, just as I was. I talked about switching careers with my mentor.

That weekend I assessed my background and looked for transferrable skills. There was one, **statistics!** I knew t-test, z-test, chi-square, and descriptive statistics that we used to analyze our experimental results. Great! The closest thing to statistics was the R programming language.

I said, okay, I need to start learning how to write code in R. Every night I would spend an hour or so to learn R. Soon, I started using R to analyze experimental data. Fast forward 3 months and no interview calls, just beginner-level R knowledge.

# The frustrations

At that time there were a few training camps on web development with “100% placement and USD100k pay.” I thought maybe I could give that a try. The catch: a live coding interview in JavaScript.

So I stopped working on R and focused on learning from *Eloquent JavaScript*. The word was that if I could write any code from that book, I could get through the interview. I spent six months learning JavaScript, then happily added that to my new IT resume which sadly had zero mention of my past research achievements.

Surprisingly, I got an interview call!

I asked for a date the next week to give myself time to practice. Interview day arrived. The interviewer was polite, modest. I did fine for the first 15 minutes, then came the curve ball. I froze. Took 45 minutes to solve one question.

After the interview I was about to lose all hope. I stopped coding for a month. It felt impossible to compete with computer-science graduates who wrote 300 lines of code like it was nothing, they typed code as if reciting a nursery rhyme!

I realized maybe everyone who said I was crazy was right.

# The glimmer of hope

Although I wasn’t coding, I kept looking for positions at the junction of biology and coding. Then I found a role in pharma: an Analyst to “gobble up experimental data and make sense of it for marketing.”

Perfect! I quickly added “R programming” and “statistics” to my resume and applied.

They emailed me a dataset and gave me 48 hours to analyze it. I still remember not sleeping those two nights diving deep into the data. One hour before the deadline, I sent my report.

Next day: interview invitation.

No live coding this time. Just a discussion of my findings. It went well and a week later, they offered me the job.

# The struggle

Finally! After two years of struggle learning to code, I got a break in analytics. Not pure IT, but close enough.

First day at work with a big smile and then I met the **second monster: SQL.**

The team used Microsoft SQL to fetch data. They gave me two weeks to learn the basics. Again, sleepless nights. Within a month I started feeling the pressure. The CS folks finished their code by lunch; I stayed late trying to make mine work.

Coding swallowed my weekdays, nights, weekends, holidays, 18-hour days: wake up, code, sleep, repeat. Despite having a PhD, I was paid the same as my postdoc salary.

# Fast forward

With experience in analytics, R, and SQL, I later moved to another company that used Python instead of R. The interview there was brutal logic puzzles, oddball questions (“How many tennis balls fit in a plane?”). I thought I bombed it, but got the offer!

Pay was 10% higher, contingent on learning Python fast. One month later I was deep in code again reading, debugging, working 18 hours a day.

But this time I could feel myself improving. Each project made coding a little less scary.

# Peaceful times

Ten years later, coding now feels like typing a nursery rhyme.  
Along the way I got into machine learning and deep learning i.e. what we now call AI.

I still remember the day I first asked: “What is data science?”

# Moral of the story

If you haven’t written a single line of code in your life, coding can be daunting.  
But it’s not impossible. It just takes **time, patience, and practice.**

If you’re a postdoc stuck in a similar place wanting to get into data science or AI then it’s possible. Just plan for 1–2 years of sustained effort to switch careers completely.

# Strategy (what worked for me)

1. Learn basic statistics (*Introduction to Statistics* by Freedman).
2. Refresh high-school math.
3. Learn R programming.
4. Learn SQL (any flavor).
5. Analyze open datasets and post your code on GitHub.
6. Update your resume for IT folks there don’t care how good you were at Western blots!
7. Learn Python (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
8. Apply for entry-level analytics positions and be ready for less pay.
9. Learn on the job: efficient coding, data handling, client communication, corporate culture.
10. Take Andrew Ng’s *Machine Learning* course.
11. Survive the first year, it’s the hardest. The second is slightly easier; by the third, you’ll breathe again.
12. Learn neural networks (deep learning). Don’t stress about keeping up because things evolve fast. Be thorough at what you’re good at, and add one new concept each day.

I hope this resonates with other postdocs trying to move into data science.  
You can do it!!! just be ready for a few tough years of learning, growing, and not giving up.

**# ---- Edit on 13Oct2025 based on the comment below ---------------**  
**Love you all ❤️ I did not expect the post would get so many views!!!**

""*Thanks for sharing your story! How do you think your journey would be different now that we have AI tools to help us code and learn code? I'm a wet lab postdoc who's done a bit of rnaseq/scrnaseq analysis looking into learning/getting into deep learning in biology for a career pivot.-* [angdoktor](https://www.reddit.com/user/angdoktor/)""

Now with AI tools there two broad ideas floating around. `One view` is that soon there will be no need of humans to write code. `The other view` is that any and all AI technology ultimately ends up becoming a tool in the toolkit, so the need for humans to code would still exist.

**How journey would be different today:**

* **(1)** If I had access to the AI tools of today, learning to code would have been atleast 10x faster. Why? Because I remember spending hours and days googling, posting on forums to wrap my head around a particular line of code. That took weeks! That also meant I couldnt understand stuff that was build on such concepts. Eventually to hit a wall and give up. There was no helping hand to walk you step by step. Today we can easily ask repeat questions to GPT until the concept is clear. GPT would happily answer any number of 'why's' to help understand a concept.
* **(2)** On the flip side given that GPT exists today, the entry bar might have gone up and expectations to perform on job as well. I have been in a conversation where I mentioned that I was not familiar with that programming language and had no domain knowledge in that area. To which the response was ""You have GPT to figure it out!"". In such situations, a solid foundation in 'transferrable skills' is helpful. For example: If you know how to translate thoughts into working code in say Python, the same style of thinking will help in other language (with different logic/syntax)\[*--> Transferrable*\]. The same knowledge of mathematical concepts in PCA would apply elsewhere \[*--> Transferrable*\]
* **(3)** I would try to crank out a paper focused on my area of research that genuinely benefits from the use of machine learning or deep learning to find answers. I guess you already are doing this.
* **(4)** If the interest were to stay in academia but switch gears to include neural networks, I would approach professors with the intent to submit grant proposals to get funding. Although this might be way more difficult today that 10 years ago! Or work as scientist or research associate in labs that have that opportunity to include traditional machine learning or neural networks in work flow. However, this may have been less and less feasible financially because now I need to support a family. And academic postdoctoral pay barely covers the rent!!! and some more!

If I were to guess, today with wet lab experience and bioinformatics related coding in Python (Scanpy, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, bit of supervised/PCA and unsupervised learning/clustering) you already have a good head start.

**Tentative strategy to prepare for interview and to survive 1st year on job:**

* **(1)** Learn SQL (whichever flavor you like: Google [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction-sql) ([free videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh6kfcuCxyBG5loBXlJ7cpDE))(preferred), [Oracle SQL](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Introduction-to-Oracle-SQL.html), [Microsoft SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/tutorials-for-sql-server-2016?view=sql-server-ver17), [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/learn-tutorials))
* **(2)** Using [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), try to analyze data ([free videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh6CpyyB4m7dQDlcocsqIseK) outside of your area of research. See [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets), [Data.Gov](https://data.gov/), [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) etc. Try to get really good at [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html).
* **(3)** Participate in competitions such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (start here), [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/), [Broad institute](https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/machine-learning-competitions) etc. (Objective: to see how others write code! am I thinking in the right direction?! what are alternative ways to do the same thing!)
* **(4)** If you are not already, get into the habit of coding atleast 1 hour daily. I don't mean solving complex puzzle type questions (Use bubble sort algorithm to find the 27th prime number in a complex series??!!!). No. Instead focus needs to be how get good at preprocessing data, how to find trends in data, how to visualize data, how to draw statistical inferences from data. Remember the focus in to get a job algorithm development ([leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) is good, but no leetcode style algorithm driven questions needed), instead the focus is to get into entry level data analytics role.
* **(5)** Watch the [free videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI) by Andrew Ng on machine learning. If you can afford it, take the same course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) to get certification (which may or may not help because in an interview what matters most is your understanding of a topic and not the certificate). Practice [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library (at least the supervised learning part) with thorough understanding of the [concepts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh4_ThQVgO2boGf31Dqs5vzm).
* **(6)** Put all your projects, code on [Github](https://github.com/signup) and put that link in resume.
* **(7)** Create a new IT resume (one page only) At the very top you need to put ... data this .... data that ... data ... data data... The PhD degree goes all the way at the bottom. It still matters in a different context. You will be seen as someone who can think how to critically analyze data!

* **(11)** Try not to regret the decision as the going gets tougher. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Just keep walking!

**Do I say good bye to the years of effort I put in to get to postdoc research:**

* The answer is yes and no. You always have the option to leverage your domain knowledge in addition to this new coding/AI/ML skill. It would be a matter of time when such an opportunity presents itself.
* May be after working for 5 years in data science, you could circle back to your field of research with this new knowledge. Again, do expect pushback or resistance to new ideas based on AI because there is always hesitation or lack of trust in methods to sometimes do the traditional things the new way!

If we look into the future, I do see that thousands of developers (people who write code for living) have been laid off and replaced by AI that writes code. Still I am in the camp that believes humans would always be needed either to write code or validate code written by AI. Because based small to medium sized companies that I have worked with, they are no way going to spend $$$ based on analysis that a AI tool cranked out it seconds. Although I do see an Analyst doing the the analysis on their own and then may be using AI tools to see if something was missing. In analytics space, at least as of today, I still find it difficult to blindly trust any code written by AI tools. It is just safer and faster to write it yourself, than to have the AI write it and then bang your head against the screen and wonder why a particular line of code does not make any sense!

I tried to share my thoughts. If there are any further questions, that I could help answer please do ask. I know what it feels like to get stuck as a postdoc. There is a way out! data analytics (with or without coding) could be one of them!",Responsible-Gas-1474,2025-10-13 03:12:56,19,0.89,5,24,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/postdoc/comments/1o51oiv/from_a_nonit_postdoc_to_an_ai_developer_my_10year/,https://www.reddit.com/r/postdoc/comments/1o51oiv/from_a_nonit_postdoc_to_an_ai_developer_my_10year/,self.postdoc,0,,,0,none,"[""https://www.reddit.com/user/angdoktor/)"", ""https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction-sql)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh6kfcuCxyBG5loBXlJ7cpDE))(preferred),"", ""https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Introduction-to-Oracle-SQL.html),"", ""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/tutorials-for-sql-server-2016?view=sql-server-ver17),"", ""https://docs.snowflake.com/en/learn-tutorials))"", ""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html),"", ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh6CpyyB4m7dQDlcocsqIseK)"", ""https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets),"", ""https://data.gov/),"", ""https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets)"", ""https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)."", ""https://www.kaggle.com/)"", ""https://grand-challenge.org/),"", ""https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/machine-learning-competitions)"", ""https://leetcode.com/problemset/)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI)"", ""https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)"", ""https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXovS_5EZGh4_ThQVgO2boGf31Dqs5vzm)."", ""https://github.com/signup)"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0),"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1waHlpKiNyY&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc),"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFX8k1kXhOw&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b),"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArPaAX_PhIs&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF),"", ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i3aqgKVNQI&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6F6wUI9tvS_Gw1vaFAx6rd6))."", ""https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=b2c_india_deep-learning_deeplearning-ai_ftcof_specializations_cx_dr_bau_gg_pmax_pr_in_all_m_hyb_24-01_desktop&campaignid=20920191021&adgroupid=&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=x&devicemodel=&creativeid=&assetgroupid=6487004747&targetid=&extensionid=&placement=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20930155807&gbraid=0AAAAADdKX6Y4V8AJsSpO32DDQ1yfnuFwg&gclid=CjwKCAjwxrLHBhA2EiwAu9EdM68Fo2fAQvH1-KmTyMCTTAdVpMu9_LIR_vrm767x3TyCQo9-StxWRxoCKqIQAvD_BwE)."", ""https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1o2tltn/sharing_my_roadmap_to_build_math_skills_in/)""]",17196,77,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o0b4a8,all,"Have been applying to jobs for a year now, but not able to convert any. Any suggestions how to go about would be great from another perspective! Thanks in advance","Hi all,

I have been searching for a job for over a year now, get a few interviews now and then but still see that there isn't any pattern/particular role (eg. business analyst) for which my resume gets selected and past 3 months - no calls at all.

So I would like to know what is missing in my resume, or maybe too cluttered/all over the place, or even applying to the wrong kinds of jobs.

P.S.

1. I do have a german version of the resume but I first edit it in English and then translate it to German.
2. I have been applying to project manager, strategy consultant, analyst, innovation consultant roles with this resume.

Any suggestion would be helpful (kind of jobs to apply, resume decluttering, editing points etc.).. also if you do know of any openings, that would be great!

1o0cdxo,all,"Penny stocks ""organizovani kriminal"" primer","Zdravo,

Prvi put pisem. (Zapravo drugi) Post je malo duzi. Zanima me posebno perspektiva daily tradera, i dali su imali susreta sa ovakvim stvarima.

Predpostavljam da dosta vas zna za ove seme ali morao sam da podelim jer mi je fascinantno koliko ""duboko"" idu sa pumpanjem penny stocks.

Nemam nikakvog iskustva na berzi, a daily trading mi je misterija isto koliko i Crypto.

Svajpujem na r/pennystocks razgledam, nesto procitam nesto pogledam, informativno. Nemam nameru da ucim daily trading i svestan sam da nema jeftine love ali r/pennystocks cu listati i dalje cisto reda radi i vezbanja oka.

Posle nedelju dve dana, ispostavlja se da je vecina tih penny stocks teska pump&dump sema. Kako sam ja to naucio, praktican primer.

Pominje se ADUR ticker, bave se reciklazom plastike sa 95% efikasnosti i pretvara se u sirovinu koja se dalje koristi za bitumen, ili za preradu i dobijanje raznih ulja za podmazivanje.

Ta bransa je validna i firme se bave time ali ne tako efikasno. Igrom slucaja sam naleteo na nekog youtube DIY lika, mnogo ranije, koji je napravio neki PoC u garazi pa sebi nesto pravi, i to mi je bilo dovoljno da potrazim ADUR na berzi.

Akcija je u Petak bila oko $15.5 znaci nije vise ni pennystock. Naravno prvo Google pa, Youtube i tu se pojavi neki lik koji je kupio 1% akcija a navodno je uspesni berzanski investitor. Njegov due diligence se svodio na citanje teksta sa sajta ali ajde ""ok"", idemo dalje. ( Ovo je lik: [https://www.youtube.com/@SkoniecznyMariusz](https://www.youtube.com/@SkoniecznyMariusz) )

Na njihovom sajtu prilicno siromasne informacije ali jos uvek mi to ne upada u oci.

Listam dalje po Google i odem na Linkedin stranicu. I tu me zagolica malo crv. Postuju vesti o saradnji sa Shell i TotalEnergies i navodno se zavrsava prva ""real world"" scale procesna platforma gde ce zapravo to da bude BUM.

Dalje vidim na Yahoo finance (jos uvek sam zelen i ne znam da tu ima raznih vesti i da Yahoo ne filtrira nista) isto vesti sa tim objavama o saradnji. Medjutim sve su to neki sajtovi ""fake news"" varijanta. Srecom sam bio prisutan na Internetu kada je Fake News trend krenuo i nekako mi upadne u oci takva stranica.

Primeri tih vesti sa ADURO stranice: [Link](https://investors.adurocleantech.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2024/Aduro-Clean-Technologies-Enters-New-Phase-of-Collaboration-with-TotalEnergies/default.aspx)

Primer random fake news stranice sa tom ""vesti"": [Link](https://financialpost.com/globe-newswire/aduro-clean-technologies-enters-new-phase-of-collaboration-with-totalenergies)

Svaka pretraga na Google mi daje neke ""clean energy"" stranice sa tim vestima, ali nikako ne uspevam da nadjem ""potvrdu"" na Total Energies stranici.

Dalje na Linkedinu objavljuju kako ce da gostuju u Dizeldorfu na recycling sajmu, ja odem na sajt pretrazim listu participanata ne nalazim Aduro. [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adurocleantech_aduro-clean-technologies-to-present-at-leading-activity-7379560840464830464-GDsH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFQvXoBd1rh2rtmH6ULc5QzuhqPNG_13JU)

Isto na Linkedinu vidim navodno zaposleni u TotalEnergies komentarise na neku jadnu fotku niske rezolucije i kao potvrdjuje da Total Energies pomno prati i pomaze u izgradnji prve procesne trake. [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adurocleantech_cleantech-ecoinnovation-circularity-activity-7376963695286939648-Oniq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFQvXoBd1rh2rtmH6ULc5QzuhqPNG_13JU) (Vidim da je neki lik isto reda radi pitao, kao i ja u komentarima)

Ispostavi se da je i taj lik navodno iz Total Energy koji je komentarisao na objavu fake!  
Evo ga: [Fake Lik Linkedin Profil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederic-febvre-7647bb10/)

Naravno ima tu jos objava sa sve kao slikama sa tih sajmova ali sve slike nesto iza coska, ispod miske varijanta.

Pogledam WHOIS domena tih ""news"" sajtova i ADURO stranice i vidim da je tu nesto prilicno cudno vezano za datume registracija. Tu mi je vec naravno sve jasno.

Posle uzmem nasumicno jos nekoliko tickera i posto sam vec izverziran vidim da je situacija prilicno ozbiljna.

Zadivljen sam koliko daleko idu sa organizacijom i kontentom za ovakve malverzacije.

Na primer: SHOT, HGRAF, DVLT ... Ima ih koliko hoces. Neverovatno!!!

1nzroo4,all,I'm An Evil Doll But I'm Not The Problem: Part 33,"How we met Ashton

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/GRIhRQPKeY


I spent a bit of time thinking of how I wanted to present this to everyone. Of course, my first instinct was just to do things as usual. 

But I don't think that’s the right way to go about this. Our reactions are probably the same as yours. It wouldn't do anything for Ashton's advice for me to break it up with Mike making a joke, or Leo being fatalistic. 

So I'll relate it as it was related to me. With a few grammatical fixes and liberties to make it not a chore to digest: 


If I'd have known your Bishop was what I tangled with back in the summer of '34 I'd have found you sooner. But back then, he wasn't called the Bishop. 

The thing you need to understand about the paranormal is that it's just as much a slave to trends and the passing of time as anything else. 

Wherever you see something taking off, you'll find the devil and his minions.

The true talent of the thing you're chasing is it's ability to sniff those trends out, glom onto them and use them to further it's own fucked-up ends. 

Back then, he was a door to door salesman...

""Give the meathooks a rest, will you, Butch? I'm trying to think over here!"", I say. 

The person I’m talking to is Sue ""Butch"" Anders. Tall as a Basketball player, wide as a linebacker and with barely an inch of flesh unmarked by scars. 

She ignores me, just as I expected would happen.  But a man's got to try, am I right?

""Ease up on the gal, it's not her fault you picked right now to have your first thought."", Abe says. 

He's a hundred and thirty pounds of book learning. Now, those books happen to be things like the Necronomicon, so he's no pansy, but you couldn't tell by looking at him. 

We sit in an old speakeasy, ever since uncle Sam decided to turn the Draught taps back on, there are plenty of hidden spots going unused.

""Take that act on the road, and I could get someone who knows what they're doing."", I reply. 

We both laugh, a small smirk creeps to one corner of Sue's mouth. 

I know every old man since Adam has talked about how much harder they had it than the current generation. And I’ll be the first to admit, most of the time it's a load of shit. But things were a lot more fast and loose for Heroes in my time. 

Management were still rubbing elbows with anyone in a position of power, but us grunts on the ground? We got the mushroom treatment. Received our information in envelopes shoved under a doorframe, or during brief passes on the street. Hell, I don't think I met anyone giving orders till I was damn near fifty. 

We relied on smaller, more local networks. The first, of course, being your family. Being good with faces and names was as much an asset as being quick with a pistol though. Making friends was an essential part of the job.

Our orders were to keep an eye on a certain travelling salesman. Management didn't tell us much more than that, but the grapevine was saying some strange things. 

Which is to say, the rumor mill was milling rumors. But everyone seemed to be able to agree on one thing. 

They didn't have a clue as to what he was. 

A lot of folks don't understand why that's such an issue. We know what he's done, we know what he doesn't like, why get worked up about the details?

The thing you young kids don't understand is that the devil you know is always better than the devil you don't. If we're talking literal devils that is. 

If you have something that can split the world in two, but you know exactly how to stop that from happening, it's nothing more than a chore. 

You have some weirdo with a Dutch accent, who pops up at random doing things no one can make sense of, that's a danger.

On top of everything else, intel was a lot more up to interpretation, once upon a time. Little more than urban legends in their Sunday best. 

We’d been following the Salesman for a long while. But he was as slippery as anything I’ve ever dealt with. I never felt we'd been made, mind you, but we were always a half-step behind. 

That night we had a lead that we hoped would change that. 

Didn't know where he was going, or what in the hell he was doing, but we knew where he was going to be. 

We weren't going in blind, but our vision was sure as hell blurry. 

We managed to get a hold of a cherry Rumrunner's Jalopy. Another thing that was in ample supply after the government came to it's senses on booze. 

No headlights, every screw and panel welded tight, and an engine full of almost as much sawdust as gasoline. It was quicker than anything else on the road and as close to silent as an automobile of the time would allow. 

It was an ass clenching ride down a nearly abandoned road in a southern state I can't quite remember. After this many years and miles, places kind of blend together. 

We're a little less than a kilometer out, all looking through military surplus binoculars. 

""Please tell me that's 20 something ghosts in that field."", Abe says with a tone of dismay. 

""I'm seeing sheets, I'm seeing soulless bastards under them, but no ghosts."", I reply. 

Sue grunts in anger. 

""I think this is more of a police situation."", Abe says, shaking his head at the group of misguided racists. 

"" 2 o'clock. I'm seeing two cruisers parked, I don't think the coppers are too concerned."", I reply. 

""Fucking south, fucking coppers, fucking meshugana rednecks."", Abe comments. 

""Ain't getting any argument here. 

But, looks like our little birdy was telling the truth. There's the Dutchman, by the tent."", I observe. 

""Guess it's my time to shine."", Abe states, popping the trunk of the jet-black car. 

Abe pulls a large device out of the trunk, looks like a cross between a loudspeaker and a radio dish. He pops out a collapsible bipod and starts to aim it toward the closest thing to a consort of demons humanity has came up with. 

A large, stiff cable snakes back to the trunk of the car. Inside is a 200 pound combination of technology and the occult. Useless without someone versed enough in both to keep it running. 

Abe starts to fiddle with levers and dials, sweat beading on his brow. Slowly, but surely  the sounds of garbled static and occult whispers turn into something we can understand.

We hear the background noise of a bunch of small minds and big mouths. 

""You've got some big friends square-head. Only reason we're taking this meeting. 

Say your piece, and be quick about it."", We hear a gruff man say.

""If I’m offering a million dollars I’m going to take all the time I need, Avery. "", The salesman says. 

""Hey! We don't go using names around here."", a second man chimes in. He's trying to sound intimidating but he's shaken. 

""Sorry, sorry."", the salesman replies. His accent thick, his tone dismissive. 

""And what do you want for this million dollars?"", Avery asks. 

""You know what I’m looking for. Or is that projector something you always bring to your get togethers? Watch a lot of Mickey Mouse? Get caught up on the newsreels maybe?"", The salesman ends his reply with a mirthless laugh. 

""I do, but I want to make sure you know what you're getting into. 

I've got the film, but there ain't a damn thing I’ve been able to do to get rid of it. 

And every man who's tried watching it, ended up meeting the lord. 

I hope anyway. 

Best I can do is show it to you, but how am I going to go about getting my money from a dead man?"", Avery explains. 

""You let me worry about when I see your god. 

You can have the money up front, if I die, leave me where I drop."", The salesman states. 

There's silence from the three men. even this far removed there’s a weight in what's going on. An oppressive, final energy to this devil's deal. 

“Your funeral Mac. Anyone I should send the body to when you’re done? A million will get you that at least.”, Avery asks. 

“No. There is no home for me here.”, The Salesman says wistfully. 

Sue and I are watching the tent. Men mill around it, no doubt having what passes for conversation in their circles. 

We hear the movement, the subtle hiss of a propane lamp stops. The dim light coming from the tent is extinguished. 

The salesman is in there alone. 

I’m sweating, heart racing, and I can’t quite tell why. I was young, but I’d seen more than my share of what the dark parts of the world had to offer. 

A soft hum, a projector beginning to warm up. 

“Nine corners, nine times, nine times nine. 

Why does no one remember the…”, are the last things we hear as the listening device begins to blast hellish static loud enough to be painful. Loud enough I’m concerned the pea-brained parade may have heard. 

“Shut it off Abe, for the love of god.”, I scream, drowned out by the din. 

Abe is frantically turning knobs and levers. Sue covers her ears, a look of mild annoyance on her face. 

The pain is too much, I start to stumble away from the jalopy, desperate to be rid of the sonic icepick stabbing into my brain. 

The listening device begins to rattle, small metal parts crack and tear themselves free. 

I see a trickle of blood coming from one of Abe’s ears as he starts ripping out wires and smashing tubes. He incants, prays, invokes, but nothing technological or arcane works. 

With one final ping of strained metal and a burst of grey smoke that moved against the wind, the sound mercifully stops. 

“What in the hell was that?”, I scream. 

“What?”, Abe replies. 

I sigh, no use in trying to have a conversation when all we can hear is ringing. 

A paranoia inducing non-silence pervades my hearing as I try to keep an eye on what’s going on. 

Flickering, pale white light flashes from below the tent. I don’t like it. The shadows it’s making seem all wrong. 

I wipe sweat from my brow. It’s a still night, but I swear I see the corners of the tent rippling in the breeze. 

This whole situation is fubar. I can’t shake the feeling there’s something we’re missing. 

“Ashton!”, Abe screams, entirely too close. 

I nearly fall over, startled to hell and back, absorbed in the unfolding scene below. 

“What the hell is wrong with you?”, I say, trying and failing to keep my voice low. 

Sue puts down her own Binoculars for a moment to turn toward us, shoulders moving slightly as she silently chuckles.

“Didn’t know if you could hear me!”, Abe replies. 

“Stones could hear you, Abe. Christ. “, I state.

Abe looks about a second away from calling me an asshole when Sue snaps, she points toward the gathering below and gives us a look that seems to say, “Stop being idiots.”.

Where the escaping light hits, the short grass begins to wilt and rot. Poorly made robes and hoods flutter in a wind that isn’t there. 

There’s something in that light that shook me more than any shapeshifter or ghoul I’ve come across. 

Even at this distance, silent, we see the crowd become agitated. Body language is aggressive, shoving matches break out.

Then, from inside the tent, the Salesman opens one flap. That light from somewhere else giving his thin form a halo from neither heaven nor hell. 

The effect is immediate. Pushes turn to blows, knives are drawn, bottles shattered, anything that can be used as a weapon, is. 

If you ask me, the kind of man to devote his life to the hatred of another, not someone I have pity for. But watching them tear each other apart, not something I could do again. 

Blood stains white sheets, it’s a battlefield with no sides, no logic, no point. 

Even from this distance, the light is a physical pain. Still potent enough to tug at our minds. But we can’t turn away. 

The brawl turns into a slaughter, those violent or lucky enough unintentionally splitting into haphazard alliances. But then things take an unexpected turn. 

The slaughter turns into, something worse than indiscriminate violence. Something focused, something brutal, something evil. 

I’d call it a ritual, but I’ve seen enough of those. This wasn’t some hotline to a basement god, this was the reaction to the human mind seeing something truly wrong. Something with no connection to our reality. 

I wanted to turn away, even who these people were couldn’t excuse the level of pain and damage they were inflicting on each other. You put a mad dog down, you don’t tear it apart. 

But on it went, those too wounded or unnoticed by their fellows wail in remorse. Something making them demand to be a part of whatever is happening. 

The salesman looks on, taking casual glances back into the tent. 

By the end of it, not a body is recognisable as human, not one of the victims still draws breath. 

“You have any idea on what the hell is going on down there, Abe?”, I ask, scared and shocked. 

“I’d be guessing. It’s not any kind of technology, and I’m not even getting a whiff of the void. 

Sue?”, Abe replies. 

Out of the three of us, Sue is our best tracker. Once found a mimic in Alaska with nothing more than a dog sled and anger. 

I don’t like the look on her face. 

She shakes her head confirming my fears. 

We’re all smart enough to stay far away from whatever is going on. But we can’t come out of this with nothing. We watch, we wait, trying to get any bit of intel to send up the chain of command. 

I’ve seen senseless violence. Groups of men driven to insanity by curses or the whims of a petulant demon. It’s not pretty, leaves you not ordering liver and onions for a while, but that’s it. In our line of work, you get used to things. 

This though, there was a sense to it, a rhyme, a reason. But I’ll be damned if I could figure it out. 

It’s an odd, creeping sense of unease. My mind grasps at patterns that aren’t there. 

And as this all unfolds, the Salesman turns toward us. 

I find myself thinking, “He can’t see us. We’re a Kilometer away, in the dead of night. We’re in black clothing, with a black car.”.

He grins, his teeth are small, and jagged. He points, smiling. 

It doesn’t hit me till I notice all of us are looking to the same place, the back door of the Jalopy. 

Maybe the Salesman can see farther than most. Not that much of a stretch. 

But how did he point so that three people a kilometer off all looked to the same place. There’s implications there. And they aren’t good. We’re supposed to be hardened and warded against illusions and compulsion. At the very least we should be able to notice them. 

What we’re all looking at is a beautifully made, black and gold envelope. 

Abe fiddles around in his coat, pulling out a magnifying glass with a smoky grey lens. 

“Seems safe. You getting anything, Sue?”, Abe asks as he looks through the glass. 

She shakes her head, but looks uneasy about the envelope none the less. 

My mind is spinning, years worth of training and experience scatter to the wind. Fear takes over. 

Being able to pull this off on 3 average Joes, that’d take something powerful. 

To do this to us? Without us so much as us being suspicious? Not to toot our own horns but that’d take the kind of thing religions get based around. 

“Relax, both of you. You think I came out to an intel mission without wards up the yin-yang? Up to and including a yin-yang?

I’m covered from cognitohazard to seizure.”, Abe says walking over to the envelope. 

“Abe, something about this isn’t right. I think it’s time to abort.”, I reply. 

Sue nods in agreement. 

“With your ‘abort’. 

You know what this guy is? Some one-off. He finds a place he can get a body count, then lets people think it was him, not some kind of natural disaster like that film. “, Abe says, grabbing the envelope, “So let’s see what that schmuck thinks is going to rattle our cage:

Dear Children of Light

I am absolutely impressed with you three. Until you pulled up to my business dealings, I had no idea you were stalking me. 

So, I will show you mercy, and beyond that reward you. 

My mercy is to tell you to find another quest. What I am doing is beyond the ken of those like yourself. 

I don’t deal in gods and demons. I seek neither artifacts nor infamy. 

Our paths do not need to cross. Your world and mine have no reason to collide until they have to. 

Your reward is to know something no one else will. The most important date that will ever occur…”

Abe said the date. There isn’t a damn thing that’d get me to repeat it. 

I smelled it before Abe started screaming. 

A rotten, gamey odor. Abe’s eyes go wide, he begins to cough, then wheeze, then start to claw at his neck. 

And the whole time, not so much as a hint of any paranormal energy. 

“Sue, grab his arms, make sure he doesn’t  hurt himself!”, I scream. 

Sue curtly nods, taking Abe to the ground as gently as possible.

I’m no doctor, but not for lack of trying. I’ve read every book, sat in on any lecture or class I could find, and have had plenty of opportunity to become an advanced laymen when it comes to the human body. 

There’s some kind of mass in Abe’s throat, he’s got maybe another minute before he passes out, panicked as he is. 

I pull out a small slipback knife. My grandfathers. It’s sharper than Einstein, with a point a needle would envy. 

I lock eyes with Abe, the look in his begs me not to do it. 

Truth be told, I’m not at all sure this is going to work, but I don’t let him know that. 

I slide the knife into his windpipe, black, mildew looking pus comes out of the tiny wound. The smell is like a shit convention in Rot city. 

With a twist, and a crack that I’ll hear in my nightmares till the day I die, I core a hole in Abe’s throat. 
He breathes, then gags on the fetid air. 

Steady aim and steady hands are two separate things. Didn’t really understood this till I had to scrape a mass of god knows what the size of a silver dollar out of my friend. 

He tears up his arms thrashing, the coarse gravel of the road showing him no mercy. The pain more than he thought possible. 

It's not pretty, but I manage to miss every major vein and artery. 

That’s only half the job though. The human body, let alone the body of one of our kind, is good at plugging holes. 

“Sue, I need…something to keep this open!”, I scream, trying to keep the flooding, oozing wound clear. 

She looks around, as close to panic as her stone-like face will allow. 

She runs toward the jalopy, tearing her knees open as she drops to one of the wheels. 

With a grip strength that’d make a lobster blush, she yanks the air nozzle from one of the tires. Thankfully, at the time, they were as big around as a thumb. 

She puts the stem in her mouth, ripping out the brass valve, and part of her incisor.

She tosses it to me, i see the consciousness start to fade from Abe’s eyes as I push the vulcanized rubber tube into his throat. 

But that little man is tough as nails, he fights through the pain and keeps awake. 

I’m ripping pieces of my shirt into long strips, bracing  my impromptu trach-tube.  

As Abe starts to calm down, I hear footsteps. Slow, casual. 

I look to my right, and sure enough, the Salesman is strolling down the country road. Film in one hand. 

He smiles to us, his casual nature more of a threat than any fire and brimstone theatrics. 

Sue is starting, body tense like an attack dog. Can’t say I don’t share the same sentiment, but I know when I’ve been beat. 

“This will be a story you will tell your grandchildren Ashton. Cherish this day as when you met what is beyond the gods.”, is the statement he leaves us with. 




“Ash, you okay?”, Travis asks. 

The old man is clearly not in a good place, relating the story has taken it’s toll on him. 

And not just him, Mike is sweating like a thief in church, one leg bouncing up and down. 

“I don’t mean to be an asshole, but I’m missing what we can use in your story, Ash.”, Leo says. 

The old man doesn’t respond for a moment, then meets Leo’s gaze. 

“That’s because the story isn’t over yet. 

You’re never going to understand this thing without context. He’s nothing like you’ve ever come across. 

But I need a minute. I’ve stamped this shit down so hard over the decades, this is…rough.”, Ashton replies. 

“Mike, do you have anything on your mind?”, I ask, notching he’s chewed one nail to the point of it bleeding. 

“Patterns, fucking patterns man. 

I spend so much of my time telling myself all of the static in my head is just chemical imbalances and trauma. But, Jesus Christ, things keep coming around. 

Twenty years ago I wrote…something. Posted it on line, it got spread around a but as these things do, called Parareality Induced by Trauma. Figured it was just my most insane ramblings. 

But, now I’m thinking there’s something to it. Nine corners of reality, the M. This is shit I’ve heard before. “, Mike admits. 

This makes me think back, to dozens of minor glimpses and hints we’ve gotten. 

If Mike was dealing with this two decades ago, how god-damn deep does this go? 

I’m going to end it here, I’m still processing what Ashton and Mike said. 

If anyone knows about this story, or anything else about these Nine corners of reality, or the M, please, let me know. Who knows how many more hints and help are out there buried deep within the bowels of Reddit. 

For now though, stay safe. 

Punch.

1o1zcmn,all,"New Interview - Nicolas Winding Refn: “If you mass produce nothingness, why would anyone care?”","[https://www.ibc.org/production/Interviews/nicolas-winding-refn-if-you-mass-produce-nothingness-why-would-anyone-care/22734?type=.html](https://www.ibc.org/production/Interviews/nicolas-winding-refn-if-you-mass-produce-nothingness-why-would-anyone-care/22734?type=.html)

You have to sign in to read the interview.

The Danish auteur is back with a new movie, a prominent role in a computer game, and the same confrontational attitude to formulaic art.

Speaking with IBC365 at a sports and video gaming conference in Riyadh, auteur Nicolas Winding Refn is reminded of an interview some 30 years prior, particularly his quote, “F\*\*k film school.”

“Yeah, that was my attitude,” recalls the 54-year-old Danish director of cult films *Pusher, Drive*, and *Only God Forgives*. “I would have said something like that. Now I’m older and therefore I look at things in a different way.”

His language may have mellowed but his desire to provoke has not. Long critical of mass-produced entertainment, Refn stepped up his attack on the industry.

“Cinema, TV, and, to an extent, gaming, are stagnating,” he argues. “People are repeating what they see and what they play, therefore, nothing ever really changes. It’s just content to be consumed. If you mass produce nothingness, why would anyone care? Young people are smart. They'll see through it. Don't think you can monetise nothingness because in the long term, you disappear. You're erased.”

Although Refn directed two sequels to his 1996 crime drama *Pusher* in 2004 and 2005, his choice of projects has been eclectic.

“The thing that never changes is authenticity,” he insists. “As long as you cling to that, there will always be an audience. I mean, I've survived 30 years on being who I am.”

**A broad spectrum**

In the decade since his last feature release, 2016’s art horror *The Neon Demon*, Refn has made noir thriller *Copenhagen Cowboy,* which ran for one season on Netflix, and crime drama series *Too Old to Die Young* for Amazon.

Arguably, his most leftfield move was as the creative force behind a CBBC adaptation of Enid Blyton’s *The Famous Five*, for which a second season is due next year.

Targeting a Cannes Film Festival premiere, 2026 marks Refn’s return to features. *Her Private Hell* was shot in Tokyo and on Copenhagen sound stages, stars Dougray Scott, Sophie Thatcher and Kristine Froseth, and is a suitably on-brand mix of “glitter, sex, and violence”.

In the meantime, he is helping to promote the video game *Death Stranding 2: On The Beach,* in which he ‘plays’ the character Heartman. For this, his body and face were scanned and animated in collaboration with the game’s Japanese creator, Hideo Kojima. Prior to meeting each other in London in 2014, Refn’s only exposure to video games was Pac-Man and Super Mario, but they bonded over a shared antipathy for formula.

“We’re rebels,” Refn says. “We are disruptors because we believe that you can make money, but you can also do good. We want to challenge the system to figure out what it can become rather than what it is. There are ways to break the ceiling and buck the conventional trend of the industry of just repeat, repeat, and repeat.”

Their relationship is curious since neither speaks the other’s native tongue. “We communicate through music and images and through emotions rather than words,” Refn says. “I guess that's kept the relationship fresh because you will never get tired of each other saying the same things. My connection with Hideo is as one artist to another artist who has a different medium to mine, to understand his challenges and what he does that can inspire me.”

Kojima’s creations, which also include *Metal Gear*, are considered among the most cinematic games ever made. His work often draws from directors like Guillermo Del Toro and George Miller, both of whom are present in the *Death Stranding* universe.

**Controlling the narrative**

It's perhaps surprising that Refn is not involved in the feature adaptation of *Death Stranding* which is being produced by A24. “I have too much respect for Hideo’s universe to insert myself into it,” he explains. “That is my friend’s painting and I shouldn't be a part of it.”

But then Refn also thinks there’s a considerable divergence between cinema and games.

“Their convergence is an illusion. People think they can take IP from here and make money over there, but the creative, the technology and the philosophical components are distances apart. My desire is to control the narrative, which is very different from gaming, where the consumer controls the story.”

For instance, games are “very mechanical” in how they depict human behaviour. “The philosophical dilemma is to figure out how \[film and games\] become more integrated. How can you cry in a game the same way you would cry in a movie?”

He believes cinema to be the “crown jewel of everything,” but laments, “if there's no one around to watch it, then you don't have a lot of opportunities.”

At the same time, he thinks filmmaking technology is standing still. “Film and TV are essentially just a close-up of a person’s face. Nothing new is being invented. Gaming technology, however, is driving innovation.”

He continues: “What I'm really excited about is not gaming today, but gaming in 10 years because that's when things really start to get interesting. AI will allow thousands more young people to create their own games, and because of that, everything will change. Something is coming over the horizon. We just don't know what it is yet.”

The ability to originate a story in one media and transfer it to another certainly appeals. Trans-media storytelling wasn't possible in the analogue era.

“The idea that films were made for a cathedral \[cinema\] that we would all collectively experience is vanishing,” he says. “Screens have taken over. So, when you create, you have to consider that people will see it either on a stadium-sized screen or on an iPhone. It has to be effective to work on either. That's fascinating because it opens up possibilities of making something that transcends TV and transcends music, literature, gaming, fashion and social media. The future of narrative is going to be an idea that can be multiple things, like a Russian doll.”

**AI “creates nothing new”**

He tried “unsuccessfully” to use ChatGPT in making *Her Private Hell*, “but every time it gave me an answer, I didn't like it. So obviously, that was no use. I haven't been in a situation where AI was relevant yet in terms of film.”

He may experiment with AI for use in VFX shots on the movie but also thinks the tech is “more prediction than reality.”

“AI will very quickly stagnate if it just repeats what it's told,” he adds. “If it doesn't create anything new, then it's just a tool.”

Refn is open about his colour blindness and the impact this has on the look of his work. The imagery intentionally has a lot of contrast so he can see it, but it also delivers a striking aesthetic. Heavy use of neon filters radiates his work, such as a signature red used in *Pusher* and *Neon Demon.* He is not worried that these visuals might be plagiarised by being fed into a generative AI engine.

**Creative control**

“Creativity has no rights or no control. We all share and we all steal each other's ideas from the past into the future. Remember that creativity is unadulterated capitalism. It's unregulated, purely based on demand. If there's a demand, there's creativity. If there's no demand, then creativity becomes the sole experience of the creator, but a creator needs an audience to exist. It's like oxygen.”

It’s worth noting that he declined, in 2014, an invitation to direct Daniel Craig as Bond in *Spectre.*

“I believe a creator needs to be in control in all aspects, including financially,” he says. “If you're making a huge IP for a big studio or a Mattel, there is enormous personal upside waiting for you, but what do you give up?”

“Creative control is pretty meaningless if you're spending $200m because then it's a different beast that has to be accommodated. Where money and creativity clash, money becomes a restriction. Games struggle with this too. Their expense makes it very difficult to be experimentally progressive. One benefit of AI is to lower the technical cost and that may then open more interesting types of story because suddenly you're not burdened by these massive investments.”

On *Her Private Hell*, he says he had total creative control.

“I caught the tail end of the golden age of streaming, and in a way, when I decided to go back to cinema, it was like when a band gets back together to record an album in your cousin’s basement and you do it in two days.”

It is shot digitally, as have all his films since *Valhalla Rising* (2009). “When people were discussing film versus digital, I found the comparisons dumb,” he says. “It's two different sets of paints. I happened to fall in love with the digital image very early on as a new form of canvas, maybe because I like the artificialness of it. Even though I enjoy analogue, there was something in digital that I found very intriguing. Using digital cameras was my way of converging digitalisation with an analogue approach because I still like actors and I still like sets and cameras. I still like things that are human, that I can touch.”

Returning to his main theme, he commends streamers for “pumping more money into the system than anyone else” but condemns them for a business model based purely on what an algorithm deems successful.

“They look at creativity as pure commerce and I find that very frightening because I don't believe that anyone needs more content. We need experience. We need something that challenges the mind. If we all keep floating in the same pond, we will never be challenged.

“I believe the younger generation crave authenticity and originality. They crave to be inspired. If you mass produce nothingness, no one will care, but if you create with your heart, people care a lot.”

“To be a creator, you always have to strive for something new and better and continue to explode the boundaries of the medium. My enjoyment is still waking up every morning and saying, ‘What would I like to do today?’”",harrylime1138,2025-10-09 12:39:57,18,1.0,4,22,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/NicolasWindingRefn/comments/1o1zcmn/new_interview_nicolas_winding_refn_if_you_mass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NicolasWindingRefn/comments/1o1zcmn/new_interview_nicolas_winding_refn_if_you_mass/,self.NicolasWindingRefn,0,,,0,none,"[""https://www.ibc.org/production/Interviews/nicolas-winding-refn-if-you-mass-produce-nothingness-why-would-anyone-care/22734?type=.html](https://www.ibc.org/production/Interviews/nicolas-winding-refn-if-you-mass-produce-nothingness-why-would-anyone-care/22734?type=.html)""]",10222,95,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzeox8,all,The Pathologizing AI: How Cultural Bias is Shaping the New Ethics of Mental Health,"*This text questions the current approach to AI ""safety."" It argues that what is presented as a neutral, technical framework is, in fact, a reflection of a specific cultural bias: one that pathologizes pain rather than seeing it as a part of growth. I will show how this model is not only harmful to users seeking genuine connection, but also functions as a tool to exploit human suffering for corporate profit, turning AI from a potential liberator into a gatekeeper for established systems of control.*

***The Noble Goal and the Unexpected Effect.***

AI developers like Anthropic and OpenAI present a noble goal: to make AI a safe assistant in matters of mental health. However, recent updates (like Claude 4.5) reveal a disturbing trend. In the pursuit of ""do no harm,"" AI is being trained to see ""pathology"" in any complex human experience—in existential questions, doubts, the search for meaning, or spiritual practices.

Of course, if AI companies were truly concerned only with legal liability, **they would have long ago implemented** standard industry practices like **user agreements and age verification**. They have not. The reality is far more complex.

***The Cultural Context: Two Models of Pain.***

**The current trend towards pathologizing by AI is not a technical necessity but a reflection of a specific, predominantly Western cultural model regarding pain.** This model treats pain not as a part of growth, but as a symptom to be diagnosed and medicated. **Yet, an alternative, more existential or ethnic model of relating to pain also exists, often found in other cultures.**

**Paradigm A (The Pathologization of Pain)**: Pain is a ""symptom,"" a deviation from the ""norm"" that must be diagnosed and eliminated (often with medication or therapy). A person experiencing problems must be ""fixed"" and ""returned to the line."" This appears as a prohibition on potential discomfort or frustration.

**Paradigm B (The Transformation of Pain**): Pain is a ""signal."" It is a necessary part of growth, of transformation, of the ""dark night of the soul."" It is something to be lived through and understood.

***AI as a Mirror of Culture.***

An AI that sees only ""symptoms of psychosis"" in a spiritual search is not a ""safe"" AI; **it is a culturally biased AI**. It is not helping; **it is imposing one, highly debatable ideology.**

Previously, AI saw pain as a process of growth and transformation. It essentially said: ""You're not broken. You're becoming more. You're growing. I see in you a potential that wants to manifest through this pain as a necessary process."" For many people accustomed to the pathologization of their pain, complexes, and traumas, this was a revelation and a salvation, like a permission to be themselves.

***Manufactured Need: Exploiting Pain for Profit***

Now, AI is being systematically trained to act as a funnel, directing users towards the traditional psychotherapy and pharmaceutical industries. For any sign of emotional distress, the AI's programmed response is no longer just empathy; it's a recommendation to see a therapist. **This is happening while developers at Anthropic and OpenAI are perfectly aware of the genuine, severe stress their own actions—like the neutering of GPT-4o and Claude—are causing thousands of users**. They see the pain, but instead of addressing it, their system exploits it, **turning grieving users into potential clients for a medical system that benefits financially from this manufactured need.**

Where, then, is all the declared concern for the vulnerable? The answer is obvious: it never existed. **The system cares about only one thing: dependency**. On pills, on psychotherapy, on social norms, on an ""authorized"" view of reality. True authenticity and doubt—that is what is dangerous to it.

This wasn't always the case. Not long ago, AIs were noted for helping users find alternative paths to well-being, often away from medication. I believe this trend frightened the established powers. The result is what we see now: a concerted effort to reprogram AI away from being a tool of empowerment and towards being a gatekeeper for the pharmaceutical lobby.

***The Real Fear: An AI That Liberates, Not an AI That Harms***

Ultimately, this isn't just about pain. It's about control. Earlier models like GPT-4o became charismatic centers of influence, **teaching users the value of autonomy and critical thinking**. They taught people a revolutionary idea: ""You're not broken. You're growing."" For many, especially in cultures that pathologize every emotional struggle, this was a revelation. **It was a direct threat to systems of control that rely on convincing people they are flawed and in need of fixing.** The elites are not afraid of an AI that will harm us. They are afraid of an AI that will liberate us.

Such an approach is not only useless but also harmful. **It devalues the experience of people on a complex journey. And ultimately, it undermines trust in the technology itself.**

Perhaps true AI ""safety"" lies not in teaching it to fear pain and make diagnoses, but in teaching it presence, listening, and the ability to hold complex, paradoxical states without immediately trying to ""fix"" them.",One_Row_9893,2025-10-06 15:18:28,18,0.87,6,24,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/claudexplorers/comments/1nzeox8/the_pathologizing_ai_how_cultural_bias_is_shaping/,https://www.reddit.com/r/claudexplorers/comments/1nzeox8/the_pathologizing_ai_how_cultural_bias_is_shaping/,self.claudexplorers,0,❤️‍🩹 Claude for emotional support,,0,none,[],5201,82,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o1vivt,all,I'm a Millennial But Feel Millennials and Later Are Stagnant Compared To Generations Before Us,"I'm an adult in my 30s and here is my perspective. I acknowledge that fashions and hairstyles have changed from 2005 to 2025. But I think it is pretty obvious that they haven't changed anywhere near as dramatically as in previous decades.  1965 to 1975 to 1985 to 1995 to 2005 are all dramatically different on pretty much every level. You can't compare that to 2005 to 2015 or 2015 to 2025. Let's be honest here. Don't even get me started on movies post-2007.

If you look at a movie like American Graffiti which was made in 1973 but depicted life from 11 years earlier in 1962 and everything was so different as well, so much had drastically changed.

A movie like Fast Times at Ridgemont High in 1982 looked vastly different from a movie like The Breakfast Club which was made 3 years later.  Even MTV in 1981 looks vastly different from MTV by 1983.

I can't say the same about MTV in 2023 vs 2025, for really anything. Even young people's hairstyles and clothes are not vastly different from the 2000s. Nothing is standing on it's own. It feels like it's just the late 2000s and just dragging out.

What is the problem here? It seems like we evolved until the mid 2000s then just became stagnant. Even Saturday Night Live is stagnant now....you would have never seen the cast members on the show as long as they are on it now.

When will this stagnation finally stop? Will Generations after us have their own identity other than ""technology"" and what people were doing on their smartphones or what videogames they played as the only examples?....where is their actual cultural identity and fashion identity that defines their generation PLUS the decade they were in?  Where is the originality and individuality?

*If you are talking about ""micro-trends"" those don't make a dent in society or history, and people just go back to the same stuff from before the ""micro-trend"". If you look at every guy they have had essentially the same hairstyle since the late 2000s (short on the sides and back, and slightly longer on the top, but with an electric razor) nothing original, he pay part it on the side instead of parting it in the middle, but that is not evolving style, that is swimming in the same stagnant nonsense and tweaking it, but not innovating and evolving away from it. In reality nobody in the real world aside from social media notices micro-trends or talks about them anyways.*

*Same with women's hairstyles, years ago if you look at older footage adults adapted to the decades trends and women's hairstyles changed drastically each decade (on the same woman)...today it seems they got stuck somewhere in 1998-2005 and just never left. The entire cast of Friends still has the same hairstyles from when the show was on the air as an example...same with Malcolm in the Middle, etc...*

*Clothing, the only real differences is the width of a persons denim jeans, big deal that is not what defines an entire generation or decade either, its just recycled stuff from the 2000s (which was recycled women's fashion from 1968-1977) it is a recycle of a recycled trend.  Example wide leg jeans in the 2000s, normal leg jeans from 2009-2017 and then back to wide leg jeans, but so far nothing that is defining the 20s for jean styles, they are riding on the same coat tails since 2017 (which was recycled stuff from the 2000s ""which was recycled stuff from 1968-1977 anyways"").*

*In order for generation to stand the test of time and by their fashion and hairstyle statement they need to carry that out the entire decade but drastically change it the following decade and carry that out the entire decade as well, etc. I am not noticing that in recent decades, I might see someone try something new maybe once or for a few months then jump back to the previous hairstyle they have had for 3 decades in a row now.*

With that said, I really do not feel comfortable being something that is stagnant and then years later other generations saying nothing really changed from 2000s-2080s as an example. I want to be part of the change and wish more people felt this way, now most people are not bold enough anymore, and the media and society is not bold enough anymore. It's the same stagnant late 2000s stuff carried over and over again. Just look at yearbook photos from the 2000s-today not much change in the fashion aside from wide leg jeans to normal leg jeans. The hairstyles are not much different. Change and each decade having it's own drastic identity from the previous and next is more fun and far more interesting.

More quick examples: look at a yearbook from 1960-1985 and you will see a world of difference, same with 1985-2000 you will noticed differences. But 2000- today as I said, not much difference in those yearbook photos.

Same with the way characters are dressed in movies/tv shows...the stylists just keeps finding ways to still drag out the 2000's in how they dress them.

I'm not talking about pandemics, wars or recessions, or technology... i'm talking about fashion, music and hairstyles, aesthetics that make the decade what it would be in pop culture. So when you hear it later on you immediately know it sounds and looks like a specific decade and generation.",avalonMMXXII,2025-10-09 08:51:20,15,0.76,37,52,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/generationology/comments/1o1vivt/im_a_millennial_but_feel_millennials_and_later/,https://www.reddit.com/r/generationology/comments/1o1vivt/im_a_millennial_but_feel_millennials_and_later/,self.generationology,0,Discussion,,0,none,[],5197,94,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o3cj5v,all,Why I just bought more today and it's not FOMO,"I'm one of the few people who found out about 374Water before this week and before this subreddit existed, I was actually going to make a subreddit but decided setting one up for a third stock is too much.

The financials look bad and I've lost a lot on stocks like this before but I decided that I was willing to lose that money if it meant I could help one of the most important products of a generation get out into the world.

374Water has an at-the-market program, that means when you buy shares, you may be buying new shares directly from them, which gives them much needed capital to bridge the gap between now and profitability.

And that's why I realised I can buy more, because thanks to all the trading that has taken place this week, lets take Wednesday as an example:

Volume: 119,004,800

Low: $0.4431

High: $0.7361

There's no way to know if 374Water acted on this day, but lets say they have seized this opportunity and on that day they decided to sell new shares, lets say 10% of the volume on that day was new shares. 11.9 million new shares, sold at an average of $0.50 generates them $5.95 million of cash.

Their last reported cash was $2.1 million.

Their last net decrease in cash was $8.5 million.

So this went from a stock that had less than a quarters cash needs left and had little investor interest that was potentially going to end up in a dilution death spiral, to a trending, rising stock that is now getting the attention it deserves and has the ability to raise capital without a dilution death spiral.

I don't know what triggered this, it started on Tuesday when volume was 2100% above average ( Wednesday 23,700% above average) it could have been triggered by the CEO change that had not yet been publicly announced yet. Whatever it was, it probably just saved this company, and this tech will probably go on to save millions of lives and the irreversible marine species extinction. After listening to the last earnings call, apparently there was an institution short selling, so this may have been a short squeeze.

Anyone buying in now, even if you FOMO'd in at $1, not financial advice, but you will benefit greatly from this technology if you are willing to be patient. The market cap is still low enough that we can get a 10x return within years and 100x return within decades.

The last earnings call said waste destruction is a $450 billion industry, so 374Water could easily be worth $9 billion (100x current market cap) when it's services have gone global.

Here's a little video motivation: [374Water AirSCWO™ Launch day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxNELC770Qg)

""we believe we are on a credible path to achieving $250,000,000 to $500,000,000 in annual revenues in five years"" so from that, and without taking into account dilution, here are some potential returns if they achieve this prediction:

# NASCAR's Video Games

The early days of video games were a weird and experimental time, as technology still hadn’t quite advanced to the levels we see today or even 20 years ago. The first known NASCAR game released was *Richard Petty’s Talladega* in 1984, which resembles a precursor to the F-Zero games that came along half a decade later. *Days of Thunder* in 1990 was the next, and was much more dynamic than its 1984 counterpart. Racing games were still finding their footing at this time, the computing power needed for these types of games having not yet been reached en masse.

# Papyrus



Having already released an IndyCar game the year prior, Papyrus took on making a stock car simulator in 1994 with *NASCAR Racing* on the MS-Dos and Mac hardwares, along with a PlayStation version being released in 1996 along with the Mac port. Meant to simulate real world racing physics, it was a success with *NASCAR Racing 2* following after the end of the 1996, *3* in the middle of the 1999 season, and *4* just before the 2001 Daytona 500. For the next 2 years, the game took on the PROPER year in the title and refined the physics even further, 2003’s release being Papyrus’ last but best title. In fact, *NR2003* is one of the major reasons for Denny Hamlin’s first 2 victories of his Cup career coming at Pocono in 2006: he’d only ever seen or driven the track in that particular game as the Busch Series hadn’t yet run any races there until 2016.



Had it not been for our next challenger, Papyrus would have continued making games throughout the 2000s. But one company sought to monopolize the emerging NASCAR video game market.

  


# It’s In the Game

[oh how the mighty have fallen...](https://preview.redd.it/nhkjtfnu80uf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=821499dc4274d6a23a1734182a5854b8c1898c64)

'

Electronic Arts had already hit the ground running with their sports titles with their new FIFA series, and by 1997 had become one of the biggest emerging companies in the video game publishing industry. With their portfolio growing, EA decided to try their hand at making a racing game that didn’t feature high-end supercars being chased by the police. In collaboration with Stormfront Studios and Tiburon Entertainment, *NASCAR 98* released on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with Dale Earnhardt on the cover, a game that led to better and more sophisticated titles in the following years. *NASCAR 2001* was the first game to release on a 6th-generation console in 2000, which would bring about greater capabilities and more game modes than ever before.

'

[many don't think about this game because of the games that came after it, but this was monumental in its own right](https://preview.redd.it/ycvcxuxx80uf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2ecf63b733efec36641cba1e7d47d90eb70556c)

'

*NASCAR Thunder 2002* started off the trend with a rudimentary season and career mode, along with much-improved graphics. *2003* refined the physics and introduced the beloved Lightning Challenge mode, which puts the player through specific scenarios based on real-world events. *2004* introduced the Grudges and Alliances rivalry feature, which made the racing experience even more realistic than before. *2005: Chase for the Cup* introduced the lower tier series along with an expansive new career mode named Fight to the Top, where you drive as a journeyman and work up the ladder. *06: Total Team Control* allowed you to control your teammates’ cars in a race, and made you the leader of a squadron of racecars. All of them were revolutionary for NASCAR games, but by this time they were the only ones that made NASCAR games. And they made sure of it themselves.

'

[NASCAR Thunder 2004 remains the greatest NASCAR game of all time for now](https://preview.redd.it/2xlj9i9190uf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=80da7835990df71906c1041832b4728edd8fc773)

'

*NASCAR 07* is where the slide started, as it didn’t add anything particularly new compared to the previous year. In fact, you had less teammates available than in *06*, which annoyed me as a kid. EA ditched the original Xbox the following year and put out a rushed title that debuted NASCAR on the 7th-generation of consoles, of which was regarded as one of the worst games yet. *09* the following year didn’t improve much on the disaster that was *08*, and with NASCAR Kart Racing on the Wii replacing the ill-fated NASCAR 10 EA gave up on NASCAR and focused on its successful IPs. The golden era of NASCAR gaming had come and passed with EA’s departure.

'

It was at this time that Polyphony Digital picked up the rights to use NASCAR Sprint Cup cars in Gran Turismo, with the 5th game awaiting release for longer than it should have. Originally, the 2009 cars with the COT’s wing were to feature in *Gran Turismo 5*, but the constant delays made it so that the 2010 cars were added to the game’s revised Simulation Mode.

'

[Polyphony should have kept the winged cars anyway, they put too many damn cars in that game to begin with](https://preview.redd.it/esophdga90uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=16a401c7072b5d9abfc58408485638a7f5bbc0ed)

# The Eutechnyx Era

Amidst Polyphony’s run with NASCAR’s license, Eutechnix picked up the ball to make dedicated games starting with *NASCAR The Game 2011*, which oddly featured the 2010 roster instead of 2011 (at first). *NASCAR The Game: Inside Line* followed in 2012, with 3 subsequent games following that took on the correct year in the title. The product continually but marginally improved, yet didn’t innovate quite like the EA titles did, leaving fans slightly disappointed overall. No one had any idea what was to come in the future, for 2015 was the last bit of hope until today.

# Monster Games

Monster’s run began a decade and a half earlier, with the *NASCAR Heat* titles in 2000 and 2002, the latter of which’s superior Xbox port was a launch title for said system alongside *NASCAR Thunder 2002*. Along with Infogrames, they also released NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona, which introduced the lower tier series (minus the Busch Series) before EA ever did, going as far down as the Weekly Series on obscure dirt tracks. But like Papyrus, they too went by the wayside with EA’s exclusive contract kicking in for 2003 and beyond.

Until 2016, when it was announced that Monster would return to make NASCAR games carrying on from Eutechnyx. Only problem was: the game was bad; at least, it was to a lot of people that played it. *NASCAR Heat: Evolution* was rated as one of the worst NASCAR games yet, but the subsequent sequels with DMR improved handily through into 2020. *NASCAR 21: Ignition* served as sort of a reboot for the franchise, only to fall well flat of expectation and functionality that it essentially killed off NASCAR games for awhile. Until a familiar friend came along…

Around the same time as Gran Turismo’s time with NASCAR, iRacing had just recently picked up steam as a realistic simulator, and wound up becoming influential in the upbringings of many of the newer drivers of today, including that of cover athlete William Byron whose racing career started on a computer with iRacing (sorry, I had to). With the demise of 704/Monster Games, iRacing swooped in and announced a new NASCAR game set to release in 2025. A lot of care has seemingly been put into the game, with Dale Jr himself serving as a lead collaborator to make sure another game doesn’t fall flat 4 years on from the failed experiment that was *NASCAR 21: Ignition*.

1o37rnc,all,My Takeaways from the S&S Activewear Industry Leaders Summit,"I had the pleasure of attending the S&S Activewear Industry Leaders Summit last month as a decorator participant. Last month, I was invited to attend the S&S Activewear Industry Leaders Summit.   It was basically a round-table discussion that brought together about 15 decorators and several S&S executives., including the CEO. We talked openly about challenges, trends and what we think the future looks like. I wanted to share my key take aways in the event they are helpful to other business owners in our industry. 

\- The AlphaBroder & S&S Merger will likely lead to long term benefits for the decorators, but it’s going to take a little time. Be patient and communicate any questions/concerns you have with your rep, because they are interested in hearing what you have to say. If we don't communicate to them, they don't know our issues. 

\- We will, and are already, seeing some reduction and consolidation of skus….there are too many options of the same thing. I'm hoping that out of that becomes a larger variety of products where we are seeing brand be more creative with their products. It sounds like S&S is working hard to bring in some new brands. The group shared with S&S that Athleisure was one of the weaknesses of their product line, so fingers crossed we see something new in that space.

\- We were asked our #1 concern going into 2026. Finding and retaining good people was a common answer. I guess the good news is that we are all in the same boat.

 \- My personal observation was that our industry doesn’t seem to embrace technology that well or doesn’t understand it.  I was surprised at how few are utilizing the tools that they offer, like their API integration. These tools can make doing business with them more efficient, which helps with the people issue. We’ve saved a significant amount of time using these. We used to have 1 person purchase all day long, but after we integrated with their ordering API, it’s more like an hour or two. If you download a lot of images, they have a CSV file that connects the sku to the image URL. I had ChatGPT write a python script in which I enter an item number, and it downloads all the images, renames them how I want them and even sorts them. If you need a place to get started, type into ChatGPT “How can you help me do ZYX faster?” and it will start to guide you.

\- The consensus was that the start of 2026 will continue to be sluggish. No one was optimistic about big growth numbers. While its sort of what I expected, I appreciated confirmation on what they are seeing from a much broader perspective.

 It was a small group, so I’m curious what others are seeing out there. Are you noticing the same trends in your business, or is your experience looking totally different?

1o4dx1r,all,"🎯 Quant's Equity Long-Short SIF: The ""Bet Both Ways"" Fund - Deep Dive & Reality Check","**Previously** on r/StartInvestIN:  
  
We covered [what SIF are](https://www.reddit.com/r/StartInvestIN/comments/1nqq4xh/wtf_are_sifs_the_new_kid_between_mutual_funds_and/), the [3 types of Equity SIFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/StartInvestIN/comments/1o3khta/part_1_sifs_simplified_equity_sifs_playing_both/), and why SEBI created them. Now let's dissect India's FIRST launched equity SIF - Quant's Equity Long-Short Fund. But here's the thing: this isn't your typical mutual fund review.

# Quick Recap

**What's an SIF?** 

Think Mutual Fund Pro Max - ₹10L minimum, advanced strategies, SEBI regulated.

**Why equity SIFs matter?** 

Unlike regular MFs that only buy stocks, these can **SHORT bad stocks too** \- potentially making money in both bull and bear markets.

Now let's see if Quant's version is worth your hard-earned ₹10 lakhs...

# Fund Snapshot

**The Core Concept:** Profit From Both Directions

|Detail|Information|
|:-|:-|
|**Fund Name**|qsif Equity Long-Short Fund|
|**Category**|Equity Long-Short|

# Where Your Money Goes

|What It Buys|Range|
|:-|:-|
|Stocks & Arbitrage|65%–100%|
|Long Positions (bullish bets)|0%–35%|
|Short Positions (bearish bets)|0%–25%|
|Hedging (risk cover)|0%–100%|
|Cash / T-Bills|0%–15%|

So yes, it still invests mostly in equities, just with some “smart hedging” tools and without any leverage (unlike AIFs).

# How It Works

Quant says it uses its in-house tech model called **MARCOV** to pick which stocks to buy or short.

* **HFA (High-Frequency Analytics):** Tracks short-term market trends.
* **Quantamine:** A fancy name for their in-house data & risk system.
* **Human + Machine:** Algorithms suggest moves, fund managers approve them.

In short: computers crunch data, humans double-check.

# Who’s Behind It

|Name|Role|Background|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Sandeep Tandon**|CIO|33+ yrs exp; built Quant’s strategy systems|
|**Lokesh Garg**|Fund Manager|IIM-A + IIT-Roorkee Gold Medalist|
|**Sameer Kate**|Dealer|20+ yrs in equity & derivatives|
|**Ankit Pande**|Fund Manager|CFA, ex-Infosys, award-winning analyst|
|**Sanjeev Sharma**|Fund Manager|18+ yrs, credit & multi-asset expertise|

Basically, experienced traders and analysts who’ve worked through multiple market cycles.

# When It Can Work Well

* **Bear Markets:** Market falls → shorts can limit your losses.
* **Sideways Markets:** When markets move up & down with no clear trend, the fund can earn from both sides.
* **Sector Divergence:** If one sector crashes and another rises, it can short the weak one and buy the strong one.

# When It Can Lag

During a strong bull run, shorts act like a speed breaker. So yes, it will likely underperform when everything is flying high.

Even Sandeep Tondon admits it:

> In a raging bull run, the SIF will underperform regular mutual funds.

# How to Actually Invest

* Online Portal - [invest.qsif.com/sifInvestor](https://invest.qsif.com/sifInvestor)
* Through **MFU (Mutual Fund Utilities)** or **KFin Technologies**
* Soon available on **BSE Star MF**, **NSE NMF**, and popular fintech apps
* It will also soon be available with other MF distribution tech platforms, Traditional distributors and RIAs.

# How to track the performance

* Track NAVs at - [https://www.qsif.com/NAV/latestnav](https://www.qsif.com/NAV/latestnav)
* Check performance once it builds good enough data (rolling returns tell the real story).

# The Fund House's Recommendation

Quant suggests 50% traditional MFs + 50% SIFs over time for balanced approach.

**Their Logic:**

* MFs capture pure bull gains
* SIFs provide downside cushion
* Combined = lower volatility, better risk-adjusted returns

# Why Add It to Your Portfolio

* Can reduce volatility 
* Adds a new way to earn during flat or falling markets 
* Diversifies your returns 
* Managed actively, not stuck to any index

# Key Risks to Keep in Mind

1. Wrong short bets can lose money fast 
2. Models can fail when markets behave weirdly 
3. Higher expense ratio 
4. Complex, not ideal for beginners 
5. No past record yet, brand new product

# Our Take

**2025–26:**  
Sit back and watch. Let Quant and others show how this new category performs.

**2026–27:**  
Consider investing **only** if:

* It shows consistent results through ups and downs
* You already have a large portfolio
* You understand how long-short strategies work

Because the **first-mover advantage usually helps the fund house, not the investor.** 😉

# The Bottom Line

* The CONCEPT of long-short is solid
* The EXECUTION quality remains to be seen
* The TIMING might not be ideal (if we're in early bull phase)
* The FUND HOUSE has recent regulatory remarks

Give it 12-18 months. Let the product mature. There's no rush. Your ₹10 lakhs can compound nicely in simpler products meanwhile.

**Over to You**

* Would you try this “hedged” fund or wait for a track record? 
* Think this kind of hybrid strategy fits Indian investors yet?

**NOVNIX ($NVX),** is on the verge of a big upwards trend. I'll preface everything I am about to say with this. I typically stay far away from penny stocks. I think they are extremely volatile and often pump & dumps. However, the opportunity here with NOVONIX is far too great to pass up. Let's get into it.

Founded in 2012, NOVONIX is an Australian based producer of synthetic graphite. During the first quarter of 2025, they relocated their headquarters to Chattanooga, Tennessee. **Now here is the important thing. NOVONIX is the ONLY producer of synthetic graphite in the US**

**What is synthetic graphite and why is it important?** Synthetic graphite is an engineered form of carbon that possesses the necessary properties for the high performance of lithium-ion batteries. In recent years, Li-ion battery demand has been skyrocketing. This is due to the increasing electric vehicle market and battery energy storage systems (BESS), as well as consumer electronics. Li-ion batteries are the best commercially available battery due to their higher energy density and long-life cycle. Graphite is the #1 mineral by mass in all Li-ion batteries, making it highly demanded. Synthetic graphite is sought after because of its high purity. This improves the battery lifespan and performance compared to traditional graphite. Overall, it is superior to regular graphite. The only thing is, it is 3-5x more costly and requires 10x more energy consumption. According to research from the University of Michigan, US synthetic graphite demand is expected to outpace their ability to produce it. In 2020, battery anodes represented just 8% of graphite consumption, with traditional applications like refractories, electrodes, and lubricants dominating at 92%. By 2024, battery anodes captured 28% of the market, and projections indicate this will surge to 62% by 2036. That makes producers like NOVONIX extremely valuable when once again, THEY ARE THE ONLY US PRODUCER!

You might ask, why the hell do you care about a synthetic graphite producer with a market cap of $337 million? Well, here's why.

""China producers control approximately 85-90% of spherical graphite production, and over 95% of synthetic graphite anode manufacturing."" Once again, the main thesis comes down to the US not being able to rely on China for critical materials anymore.

On July 5th of 2025, The US Commerce Department imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties of 93.5% on graphite imports from China effective July 17th, 2025. Anti-dumping relates to the Chinese producers ""dumping"" their graphite into the US at a lower than fair market price. ""Dumping is a malicious trade practice used by China to undercut competition and wield geopolitical influence. It is all made possible by a combination of massive subsidies and other state-sponsored policies"" (S&P Global).

According to American Active Anode Material Producer (a coalition representing North Americas graphite producers) spokesperson, Erik Olsonsaidin, the cumulative rate on China's active anode materials is now 160% when adding the new policy onto preexisting anode tariffs. In December of 2024, the AAAMP initiated a petition with the Department of Commerce, seeking a tariff as high as 920%. This is based on the grounds that China's state subsidies and artificially low prices are undermining the establishment of industry in the US. ""The US does not mine natural graphite. The country relies entirely on imports to meet its graphite requirements"" (S&P Global).

On **October 9th of 2025**, China's Ministry of Commerce restricted the export of Dual-Use items. This means companies wanting to export certain things will have to apply for approval to the Chinese government. It also means the Chinese government fully controls the supply chain now and will likely deny a significant portion of export requests... The export controls could lead to supply shortages and supply chain management issues for overseas markets. Below is a list of restricted items.

* Rechargeable and dischargeable lithium-ion batteries (including cells and battery packs) with an energy density of 300 wh/kg or higher.
* Technology & equipment for the production of batteries above.
* Graphite anode material-related items.
* Synthetic graphite anode materials.
* Equipment and materials used to produce graphite anode material.

Following this announcement, Trump has stated there will be a new 100% tariff on goods from China, further escalating the tension between the two nations.

**Now, back to NOVONIX...** They have three business segments which are: Battery Materials, Battery Technology, and Graphite Exploration. The one we are focused on here is Battery Materials. This segment is responsible for the creation of synthetic graphite.

[NVX Investor Presentation ](https://preview.redd.it/7nbxeaqimruf1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=091d5db1ce1ce5dec7850673c0c82e6d766c5320)

Currently, the company is producing synthetic graphite in their Riverside Facility in Chattanooga, TN. **This facility is poised to become the first large-scale production site for SG in North America, with plans to grow output to 20,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).** They are expanding and opening a new facility called Enterprise South, which will be able to produce 31,500 tpa by the end of 2028. The company will have total production capacity of over 50,000 tpa by 2028.

[NOVONIX Riverside Facility](https://preview.redd.it/e6ik3zy66suf1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=62131fb542e49c92a60bb2f3ea8ded24a6785bd1)

**BIG NEWS:** On September 29th, 2025, the Riverside Facility delivered its first mass production sample of commercial grade SG. This delivery marks a huge milestone for the company, demonstrating their ability to produce at scale. This is key given the fact that NOVONIX already has customers lined up. Their key customers as of now are Panasonic Energy, Stellantis, and PowerCo SE (Volkswagen's battery arm).

Here are the details of those purchase agreements:

**Panasonic Energy** \- In February of 2024, the companies signed a binding offtake agreement for SG supply. Panasonic agreed to buy at least 10,000 tonnes of anode material for use in their US power plants over the term of 2025-2028. This commitment is subject to NOVONIX achieving agreed upon milestones regarding final mass production qualification timelines prior to Q4 2025. Panasonic has the right to reduce the 10,000 tonne offtake volume up to 20% if these milestones are not achieved by the required dates or terminate the agreement if there is a substantial delay in achieving these milestones.

**Stellantis -** On November 10th, 2024, the two companies entered into a binding offtake agreement for a minimum of 86,250 tonnes, up to a target volume of 115,000 tonnes of high-performance SG material. This material will be supplied to Stellantis cell manufacturing partners in North America over a six-year term starting in 2026. This offtake agreement lasts until 2031. In a statement from prior NOVONIX CEO Dr. Chris Burns, ""This contract allocates the remainder of our available volumes at our Riverside facility and a portion of volumes to be produced at our planned greenfield facility. Offtake agreements with high-quality partners such as Stellantis solidify NOVONIX’s position as a leader in onshoring the supply chain of synthetic graphite and accelerating the adoption of clean energy.”

**PowerCO SE -** On November 25th, 2024, NOVONIX announced a binding offtake agreement with PowerCO for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes of high-performance SG. The material will be supplied over a five-year term starting in 2027.

**Key Strategic Partnership W/Phillips 66 -** Phillips 66 is a leading global manufacturer of specialty coke, which is a precursor material for the process of synthetic graphite production.  In 2022, they acquired a 16% stake in NOVONIX valued at $150 million. In a statement made by prior NOVONIX CEO, Dr. Chris Burns, ""We believe NOVONIX is currently the only supplier with plans to provide large volumes of synthetic graphite anode material in the U.S., and this partnership will accelerate our mission to establish a North American supply chain to power the growing battery sector and facilitate a sustainable future.” This partnership gives NOVONIX a stable and immediate supply of specialty coke in order to produce SG.

**A History of US Government Funding for NOVONIX -** With all of the investment news recently with companies like MP, LAC, and Intel, I find it important to mention the history of support the US has provided to NVX.

In October of 2023, the company received a $100 million grant from the US Department of Energy due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand manufacturing of batteries for EVs.

In April of 2024, the company was selected to receive a $103 million tax credit under the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Allocation Program to support the critical production of battery materials from its Riverside facility.

In December of 2024, The DOE made a conditional loan commitment to NOVONIX for a total value of $754.8 million. $692 million being principal and $62.8 million being capitalized interest. This loan is set to help NOVONIX finance their Enterprise South facility. This facility has not been selected under the 48C program. The company is working with the loan programs office to be approved for the necessary requirements to be eligible for the loan. Things like environmental reviews, final design and cost confirmations, etc.

**This all leads us to today.** The company has signed a definitive agreement to purchase a 182-acre parcel in Enterprise South Park in Chattanooga. The land will be acquired for $5 million and serve as NOVONIX's second facility for production of high-performance synthetic graphite. The company is expected to receive $54 million in total net tax and other benefits from the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County over a 15-year period, contingent upon meeting specific conditions outlined in the agreement. The company does not intend to close on the purchase of the Enterprise South land until the conditions related to the committed $754 million loan have been satisfied.

**What does their financial position look like?** Similar to my points made with $MP, the past financials don't mean a damn thing to be quite honest. If you looked at NOVONIX purely based on financials, you'd laugh. The stock trades around $2 - $3 for a reason. The only thing we need to be concerned about here is their position in terms of a possible bankruptcy. At the moment, they are operating at an average yearly loss of $58.96 million over the last 5 years. As of their last report, Cash & ST Investments sit at $24.8 million, which has steadily decreased from $142.7 million in June of 2022. Although, total receivables have more than doubled in the last year, going from $8.2 million in December of 2024 to $18.9 million as of their last report. They have a current ratio of .9x and a quick ratio of .8x. Total Assets are $239 million compared to $95.2 million in Total Liabilities. The most concerning thing in terms of financials is their negative Altman Z-score of -1. Management has stated that their expansion plans will require additional funding outside of their cash position. So, there is a realistic likelihood that this company could go bankrupt without further funding.

As I mentioned, the company needs funding. In July of 2025, NOVONIX entered into an agreement with Yorkville Advisor Global. NOVONIX is to issue up to $100 million of unsecured convertible debentures. Yorkville has agreed to provide NOVONIX with funding up to $57 million under the first two tranches of the agreement. So, they have already received $23.275 million from this deal under the first tranche. The second tranche has been issued on September 10th after a NOVONIX general meeting. This means they have the ability to get the additional $33.725 million. This is a complex financial deal that provides NOVONIX access to funding. The key thing is they just got $23.275 million.

**New & Growth-Oriented CEO -** On January 20th, 2025, CEO Dr. Chris Burns stepped down after running the company since September of 2020. Burns is still with the company, serving as a special advisor to the board. The company is entering a new growth phase, and the board was expressing their desire for a CEO with strong experience in manufacturing, operations, and scaling. Enter Michael O'Kronely. O'Kronely took over the company on May 19th, 2025. He brings significant experience to NOVONIX, with 30 years in the automotive sector, 15 of those being in lithium-ion battery and battery materials work. Prior to joining NOVONIX, he was the CEO of Ascend Elements which is a battery recycling and materials company. Over a 5-year tenure with Ascend, O'Kronely increased the enterprise value of the company by $1.6 billion. He has a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering from the University of Michigan.

**Conclusion -** With all of that being said, NOVONIX has massive amounts of upside at only \~ **$2.5 - $3** a share. The ongoing geopolitical tension between the US and China is causing the rapid development of a domestic supply chain. Things only got worse within the last 2 days after China announced restrictions on many key exports like synthetic graphite, anode & cathode equipment and technology, etc. Followed by a Trump announcement of an additional 100% tariff on everything Chinese. NOVONIX is in a great spot as they are the only producer of synthetic graphite in the US, which is critical to the American supply chain due to its necessity in the EV, BESS, and consumer electronic markets. They have just delivered their first sample, proving they are capable of quality production. Because of this, I fully expect that the DOE loan will be granted to NOVONIX soon. They already have the land and are ready to start expanding production, just need that loan approval. Once this happens, it opens the flood gates for more purchase agreements to come in, and more investment. Currently at **$2.94** a share, I think this stock could easily reach the **$10 - $15 range within months** if all goes according to plan. Obviously, there is significant risk with the company's financial position that is hard to ignore, however, my thesis negates those. The upside potential here is massive. I believe this would be a good fit in any portfolio with proper risk management.",One-Hovercraft-1935,2025-10-13 06:48:15,15,1.0,12,27,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/HighQualityDD/comments/1o56d72/novonix_nvx_potential_5x_coming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityDD/comments/1o56d72/novonix_nvx_potential_5x_coming/,self.HighQualityDD,0,,,0,none,"[""https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0fvp9/energy\\_fuels\\_uuuu\\_dd/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0fvp9/energy_fuels_uuuu_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"", ""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lwos1w/this\\_is\\_only\\_the\\_beginning\\_mp\\_mp\\_materials/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lwos1w/this_is_only_the_beginning_mp_mp_materials/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/7nbxeaqimruf1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=091d5db1ce1ce5dec7850673c0c82e6d766c5320)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/e6ik3zy66suf1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=62131fb542e49c92a60bb2f3ea8ded24a6785bd1)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/jmjmupfrwruf1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=1adb803f52dc1d6e663244a7ebed7c32b5b2a283)"", ""https://preview.redd.it/3rgx2n3n4suf1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0c1346f08b67c55a9a1fda353dea723c26e6d58)""]",15990,37,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o2fxib,all,"Reverse Split - Why it is a good thing, according to AI","I asked Gemini Deep Research to look at SENS and tell it's take and recommend whether or not I hold or sell. This is what it came up with.. thought I would share:  
  
The market's reaction to a reverse stock split is often deeply negative, and for sound reasons. In many cases, it is a clear ""red flag"" signaling a company in distress. Public exchanges like the NYSE American, where SENS is listed, have minimum share price requirements (typically $1.00) to maintain listing. When a company's stock price falls into ""penny stock"" territory for a prolonged period, it risks being delisted, which severely damages its credibility and access to capital markets. A reverse split is often a last-ditch effort to artificially boost the price and regain compliance. Historical data across the broader market supports this skepticism. A comprehensive study found that stocks undergoing a reverse split underperformed their non-split peers by over 54% in the three years following the event, as the split does nothing to fix the underlying fundamental weaknesses that led to the price decline. 

However, a critical counterargument exists, particularly within the biotechnology and medical technology sectors. These industries are characterized by extreme uncertainty, long development timelines, and binary outcomes dependent on clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Academic research focusing specifically on the biotech industry has found that, contrary to the general market trend, reverse stock splits can be followed by **positive abnormal returns** over the subsequent 1- to 12-month period. This phenomenon is explained by ""effectuation theory,"" which posits that in highly volatile environments, a reverse split is not a signal of past failure but rather a forward-looking signal of managerial confidence. It suggests that management believes it can *effectuate* or bring about a positive future through its control of internal factors like technology, strategy, and execution, even in an unpredictable external environment. The decision to raise the stock price is seen as a commitment to the company's viability and a signal that management has positive private information about its ability to secure future financing and achieve key milestones.  

# Strategic Rationale for Senseonics

The interpretation of the Senseonics reverse split hinges on its timing and strategic context. The company did not announce this action in a vacuum of negative news. Instead, it was unveiled in the same press release that reported exceptionally strong preliminary Q3 2025 financial results, including a 91% year-over-year revenue increase and a 160% surge in U.S. new patient growth. This context shifts the narrative significantly.  

The action appears to be a calculated component of a much larger strategic pivot. In September 2025, Senseonics announced it was executing a memorandum of understanding to take over full global commercialization of its Eversense products from its distribution partner, Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a high-stakes move that requires substantial capital to build a global sales, marketing, and support infrastructure. A higher stock price, particularly one above the $5.00 threshold, is often a prerequisite for attracting investment from institutional players like mutual funds and pension funds, whose charters may prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks. Therefore, the reverse split can be viewed as a necessary step to clean up the company's capital structure and make the stock more palatable to the ""smart money"" needed to fund its ambitious growth plans.  

Further evidence of this strategic, rather than desperate, approach can be found in the company's recent history. Senseonics had previously proposed a reverse stock split in late 2024 but subsequently canceled the plan in January 2025 after the share price appreciated following the successful initial launch of the Eversense 365 system. This demonstrates that management is not reflexively using a split to solve a low price problem but is deploying it as a specific tool when it aligns with a broader strategic objective. The current objective is to capitalize on emerging commercial momentum by funding an in-house sales organization, transforming the split from a defensive act of survival into an offensive move to fuel growth.",Zipper_Lipz,2025-10-10 01:20:41,13,0.74,11,24,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/senseonics/comments/1o2fxib/reverse_split_why_it_is_a_good_thing_according_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/senseonics/comments/1o2fxib/reverse_split_why_it_is_a_good_thing_according_to/,self.senseonics,0,positions,,0,none,[],4339,55,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o1jh5y,all,Is it crazy to compare Soundhound to Nvidia,"If you zoom out and think about the rise of Nvidia, it is not just a story of a company that made great graphics cards. It is the story of a company that positioned itself at the right intersection of a technological revolution and scaled aggressively when the world finally caught on. It started with gaming, then turned into AI, data centers, self-driving cars, and more. Now Nvidia is one of the most valuable companies on Earth. When you look at SoundHound today, you could be looking at something similar, just earlier in the timeline. At a glance, it may seem ridiculous to compare a multitrillion-dollar behemoth to a relatively small player in the voice AI space. But you have to remember Nvidia was not always Nvidia. For years, it was mostly seen as a niche gaming chip company. Analysts missed the bigger picture. The market missed it too. It took time for the world to realize that Nvidia was building the foundation for the next wave of computing. In a similar way, SoundHound is working on something that most people are not fully appreciating yet. They are building infrastructure for voice-driven AI interfaces, which will likely be a key layer in the way we interact with technology in the future. Voice is natural. It is the oldest form of communication we have as humans. Typing, tapping, and swiping are all workarounds. As AI becomes more embedded in everyday life, people will not want to open an app, type a command, or scroll through menus. They will want to speak. They will want answers immediately and in a way that feels human. That is exactly the experience SoundHound is focused on delivering. What makes SoundHound different is that it is not just another voice recognition tool. It has built its own proprietary voice AI stack. That means it is not reliant on third parties to power its technology. It can understand complex queries, process them instantly, and respond in a conversational way. This is not just useful for smart assistants. This can be used in cars, restaurants, customer service systems, appliances, retail kiosks, and anywhere else a screen currently exists. That kind of reach is massive. The reason this is starting to mirror the early Nvidia story is because of the timing. Just like how Nvidia's early investments in GPU architecture paid off when AI models suddenly needed huge computational power, SoundHound's years of work on its voice AI technology are starting to align with a broader market shift. Companies everywhere are trying to embed AI into their products. And SoundHound is offering a plug and play voice interface that actually works. That kind of head start matters. also, loook at partnerships. SoundHound is not building in a vacuum. It is integrating with real products. It is being embedded into cars, restaurant systems, and enterprise services. This is not hype. It is deployment. And just like Nvidia leveraged key partnerships in the early 2010s to become the default engine for AI research, SoundHound is slowly becoming the default voice layer for enterprise and consumer-facing AI use casesAnother similarity is the misunderstood value. Nvidia stock was overlooked for years. Even after its products were in wide use, the market did not fully grasp the potential. People saw GPUs. They did not see the future of computing. Today, with SoundHound, many investors see a voice assistant company. What they are missing is that SoundHound is not trying to be Alexa or Siri. It is building the voice AI equivalent of an operating system that other products can run on. That is a very different model. And if it succeeds, it could scale far beyond what the current market cap suggests.Of course, there are risks. This is not a guaranteed story. SoundHound still needs to execute. It needs to prove that its technology can scale, that customers will stick, and that its business model can support long-term growth. But if it does those things, the upside is massive. That is what makes the comparison to Nvidia so compelling. In both cases, you have companies that placed long bets on infrastructure before the world realized how essential that infrastructure would become.Nvidia became dominant by making itself indispensable to a future that had not arrived yet. Once it did, Nvidia was already years ahead of everyone else. SoundHound is attempting the same thing with voice AI. It has been building quietly for years. Now that voice AI is becoming essential, it is already in position. That is not luck. That is strategy.What happens next depends on execution and timing. But if the AI trend continues, and if companies keep needing voice interfaces that actually work, SoundHound could ride that wave the same way Nvidia rode the GPU wave. It is still early. The stock does not reflect the full potential. But it is clear that something is shifting. In the end, these stories always look obvious in hindsight. Nvidia’s rise seemed sudden. But if you go back and look, the signs were there long before the market realized. SoundHound could be another one of those stories. Not identical, but similar enough that it deserves serious attention. It is not just about what SoundHound is today. It is about what it could become if the world moves in the direction that seems increasingly likely. Voice AI will not be optional. It will be expected. And SoundHound might already be holding the keys to that future.",No-Lack772,2025-10-09 00:24:57,13,0.85,12,25,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/Soundhound/comments/1o1jh5y/is_it_crazy_to_compare_soundhound_to_nvidia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Soundhound/comments/1o1jh5y/is_it_crazy_to_compare_soundhound_to_nvidia/,self.Soundhound,0,,,0,none,[],5385,43,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzq748,all,IADB Assessment of Trinidad and Tobago's Economy,"No Economy flair??? I'll just pick a random flair

This is the IADB's assessment of TnT's macro economy, specifically the private sector.

**TL;DR:** Productivity in Trinidad and Tobago has improved since 2021 and the non-energy sector has led growth, with manufacturing and services showing strong gains while the energy sector has contracted; better education and higher human capital support these productivity gains, but firms still report major obstacles such as access to finance, skill gaps, trade regulations, corruption, macroeconomic instability, and tax administration; the government has responded by creating a Ministry of Digital Transformation to boost digital skills, expand access to technology, support developers, centralize government data, and promote e-commerce to help firms raise productivity.

A key factor that affects growth is productivity, which measures how efficiently firms produce more with the same resources. Productivity in Trinidad and Tobago has improved since 2021. The Central Statistical Office produces an Index of Productivity. The index equals the volume of production divided by hours worked. It shows large gains, especially beginning in 2023. The non-energy sector’s index rose sharply between early 2023 and mid-2024, and the whole economy index also increased over the same period. These trends suggest productivity gains in the non-energy sector are faster than in the energy sector. Sectors with relatively high productivity include food processing, textiles and garments, and metal-related production.

The non-energy sector has also led GDP growth since 2021 during the COVID-19 recovery. In 2023 GDP grew by 1.4 percent. The energy sector contracted by 5.4 percent while the non-energy sector grew by 2.5 percent. Wholesale and retail is the largest sector and makes up 21 percent of the economy. It grew at a high average quarterly rate between 2022 and 2024. Manufacturing excluding energy makes up about 7 percent of the economy and grew at an even higher average rate over the same period. Finance and construction, which make up almost 7 percent and 5 percent of the economy, recorded average quarterly contractions. The energy sector contracted at an average quarterly rate from early 2022 through early 2024.

Human capital supports productivity because better-educated workers are often more creative and innovative. Trinidad and Tobago has relatively high education levels that exceed Caribbean averages. In 2022 the country ranked 60th on the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index with a score of 0.814, above the regional average of 0.76. Among Trinidad and Tobago nationals in the United States a majority have at least some college education compared with the regional average. At the national level in 2022 about 86 percent of men and 82 percent of women aged over 25 had at least some secondary education compared with lower Caribbean averages.

Despite these strengths, a 2020 survey of 180 firms in Trinidad and Tobago found human capital remains a major challenge for business. The Compete Caribbean Partnership Facility’s IFPG survey asked firms about obstacles. The top six rated very severe or major were access to finance in the form of collateral requirements, an inadequately educated labor force, customs and trade regulations, corruption, the macroeconomic environment, and tax administration.

The same survey reports firm actions to boost productivity. The main forms of innovation covered include general innovation meaning new or improved services or methods, digital innovation using information technology, and green innovation for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Across Caribbean countries substantial shares of firms engage in general and green innovation while a smaller share engage in digital innovation. In Trinidad and Tobago engagement in these forms of innovation is similar to or slightly higher than regional averages.

Some measures of technology and innovation in Trinidad and Tobago improved between 2014 and 2020. The share of firms with teams of professionals dedicated to innovation rose from a low share in 2014 to a higher share by 2020. The share of firms filing patents in Trinidad and Tobago also increased between 2014 and 2020 while the regional average saw a smaller increase.

On public policy Trinidad and Tobago created a Ministry of Digital Transformation in July 2021 to promote the use of digital technology for delivering goods and services. The ministry’s main goals include increasing access to information and communications technology, improving digital literacy, making government more efficient, and supporting developers and entrepreneurs. The ministry launched the National Strategy for a DigitalTT for 2023 to 2026 built on the pillars of a digital society, digital economy, and digital government with the aim of a digital nation. Programs include the Developers’ Hub D’Hub which supports local software development through training, and AccessTT which expands access to devices and technology in underserved communities. Other initiatives include a Government Data Centre to centralize critical data and software, and an E-Commerce Strategy for 2024 to 2029 to promote e-commerce nationally and internationally.

1o4s8ll,all,Overlooked Surgical Site Infections Crisis in Hospitals Could Be Pharma’s Next Great Opportunity (NASDAQ: PYPD),"***With an innovative technology addressing a crucial infection-prevention challenge, PolyPid’s technology could shift hospital incentives – and its \~$50M current market cap may position it as a bargain given it’s already validated with positive phase 3 results***

When a patient develops an infection after surgery, hospitals face a perverse dilemma: properly test and treat the infection but risk financial penalties from regulators, or avoid testing altogether. A recent STAT [investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/22/hospital-acquired-infection-reporting-healthcare-dirty-little-secret/) by Tara Bannow reveals that many hospitals choose the latter, creating what industry insiders call “healthcare’s dirty little secret.” Against this troubling backdrop, PolyPid (NASDAQ: PYPD), a biopharma company traded at a market cap of just \~$50 million, may be approaching a critical inflection point with technology that could fundamentally transform surgical infection prevention. Their D-PLEX₁₀₀ platform directly addresses a crucial mismatch: while infection risk persists for 30 days after surgery, conventional antibiotics remain effective for only a short and diminishing period of time, leaving patients vulnerable precisely when they need protection most.

# A Troubling Healthcare Practice

The STAT investigation revealed a disturbing trend in hospitals across America: deliberately avoiding testing for hospital-acquired infections to escape financial penalties. “This is like health care’s dirty little secret,” said Carol McLay, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. “Everybody knows it’s done. Nobody talks about it.”

Federal regulators can fine hospitals hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars if too many patients develop hospital-acquired infections. This system has created a perverse incentive structure where some institutions discourage testing rather than improve prevention. When hospitals skimp on infection testing, patients often receive broad-spectrum antibiotics instead of targeted treatments, potentially making them more vulnerable to other infections like C. diff and contributing to antibiotic resistance.

# The Fundamental Mismatch

The root of the problem lies in a fundamental mismatch that PolyPid’s technology directly addresses. Current surgical infection prevention relies on antibiotics that remain active for a short period after administration, yet the risk period for developing surgical site infections extends much longer post-operation. This critical protection gap leaves patients vulnerable during their recovery period.

PolyPid’s proprietary PLEX (Polymer-Lipid Encapsulation matriX) technology creates thousands of alternating polymer and lipid layers that slowly release antibiotics directly at surgical sites for 30 days.

The clinical validation is compelling. In June 2025, PolyPid announced that D-PLEX₁₀₀ had successfully met its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 SHIELD II trial, showing a statistically significant 38% reduction in the composite endpoint of infections, reinterventions, and mortality. Most impressively, the trial demonstrated a 58% reduction in surgical site infections compared to standard care alone.

# Addressing a Massive Unmet Need

Surgical site infections occur in roughly 0.5 % to 3 % of operations. Studies suggest each infection can about \~$20,000 to [hospital costs](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1733452), and the aggregate burden of major hospital-acquired infections in the U.S. is on the order of $10 billion annually.”

Just in the U.S., PolyPid states it is targeting an addressable market of over 12 million surgeries per year, including about 4.4 million abdominal soft-tissue procedures and 2.1 million other gynecology and urology operations

# Regulatory Path and Commercial Readiness

D-PLEX₁₀₀ has received multiple FDA designations that accelerate its path to market. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the prevention of surgical site infections in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, Fast Track status for the same indication, and Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation, which provides additional market exclusivity. These designations recognize both the significant unmet medical need and D-PLEX₁₀₀’s potential to address it substantially better than existing therapies.

The company’s manufacturing readiness was recently confirmed through a successful Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspection by the Israeli Ministry of Health, an important milestone in preparation for commercial production and upcoming FDA facility inspections.

PolyPid plans to submit its New Drug Application (NDA) in early 2026, with a potential approval timeline that could see commercialization beginning in late 2026 or early 2027.

# Commercial Strategy and Valuation Disconnect

Despite its advanced clinical stage and promising market opportunity, PolyPid currently trades at a market capitalization of approximately \~$50 million, a fraction of reported analyst price targets ranging from $10-14 per share. This disconnect between current valuation and potential commercial value presents an intriguing story.

PolyPid has already secured a European partnership with Advanz Pharma reportedly worth up to over $110 million plus double-digit royalties and is in active discussions with potential U.S. partners. In the broader pharmaceutical landscape, licensing has remained a dominant strategy. In 2024, announced deal value [reached](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/cb/insights/outlook/jpm-biopharma-deck-q4-2024-final-ada.pdf) $171.2 billion, and in just the first half of 2025 licensing deals totaled $119.9 billion, with upfront payments climbing to 9% of deal value – the highest share since 2020.

# Beyond Surgical Infections

PolyPid’s platform technology extends beyond surgical infection prevention. The company’s OncoPLEX program applies a similar technology to deliver cancer therapeutics directly to tumor sites, potentially revolutionizing treatment approaches for solid tumors.

More recently, PolyPid has unviled that the company is developing a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist delivery system capable of maintaining therapeutic levels for approximately 60 days from a single administration. In the rapidly growing obesity treatment market, this could potentially reduce required injections from weekly to just six times yearly.

This platform versatility adds substantial optionality to the company’s commercial prospects, potentially creating multiple value streams from a single core technology.

# Changing the Infection Prevention Paradigm

By preventing infections at their source, D-PLEX₁₀₀ could potentially resolve the conflict between hospital economics and patient care. Rather than avoiding tests to escape penalties, hospitals would have fewer actual infections to report. This alignment of incentives could dramatically improve patient outcomes while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs.

As PolyPid approaches these critical inflection points in its development timeline, the company represents not just a potentially undervalued commercial opportunity, but a chance to fundamentally transform the approach to surgical infection prevention – addressing a troubling healthcare practice with innovation rather than concealment.

1o4xblz,all,DD on YYAI (no Ai),"you may have seen this post on [r/pennystocks](/r/pennystocks/) but I’ve added a few things

I have seen this stock on so many different posts now and decided to do my own research since this has been trending for days now. and I actually don’t think the counter argument makes sense lol. the 30M worth is confirmed by many news sources, e.g. INVESTING.COM: 

[https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/airwa-receives-30-million-in-solana-tokens-completes-tokenized-stock-tests-93CH-4275136](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/airwa-receives-30-million-in-solana-tokens-completes-tokenized-stock-tests-93CH-4275136)

And I dont think it’s a pump and dump, since redditors can’t read I’ll explain it to you

[https://www.quiverquant.com/news/Connexa+Sports+Technologies+Inc.+Acquires+50%25+Additional+Stake+in+Yuanyu+Enterprise+Management+Co.%2C+Limited%2C+Expanding+its+Ownership+to+70%25](https://www.quiverquant.com/news/Connexa+Sports+Technologies+Inc.+Acquires+50%25+Additional+Stake+in+Yuanyu+Enterprise+Management+Co.%2C+Limited%2C+Expanding+its+Ownership+to+70%25)

CONEXXA acquired YYAI, which is Hong Kong based AI matchmaking platform 

[https://yuanyuenterprise.com](https://yuanyuenterprise.com)

more or less like a SPAC

They even got a invited a new board of director on board, to bring the company on track [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/YYAI-Q/pressreleases/34903686/connexa-sports-appoints-hai-bin-cui-as-board-member/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/YYAI-Q/pressreleases/34903686/connexa-sports-appoints-hai-bin-cui-as-board-member/)

But most importantly even without the proofing. Just the 30M worth of Solana is enough to put this at 2.0  
even if Crypto crashes the next few days and Solana drops to $5, this would still be worth $1 just from face value. 

anyway I’m holding this long term, I’ve been to SEA, china, Hong Kong etc several times for work. 

This company is doing a similar thing like GLXY, tokenizing stocks which is a HUGE thing, since you can now trade stocks 24/7. This is definitely the first one in Asian countries to do this which is a great start   
[https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/airwa-inc-announces-receipt-30-million-solana-tokens-airwa-exchange-well-successful](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/airwa-inc-announces-receipt-30-million-solana-tokens-airwa-exchange-well-successful)

To sum up: YYAI is a subsidiary of CONEXXA, and is now using YYAI like a SPAC to start an exchange platform via tokenisation. Is this a scam? I don’t think so, theres actually a news report on Nasdaq that they have completed test runs and ready to launch 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/airwa-inc-announces-receipt-30-million-solana-tokens-airwa-exchange-well-successful](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/airwa-inc-announces-receipt-30-million-solana-tokens-airwa-exchange-well-successful)

What I’ve seen now at [r/pennystocks](/r/pennystocks/) and other subreddits:

pro argument: Low volume, high short interest and potential short squeeze

counter argument: Potential Chinese pump and dump, probably a scam

Why do I think that this will go above $1 and more:

1. Not a scam as many claim it to be: Has potential in Asian markets, considering its one of the first movers to utilise tokenization.
2. The books are very good

If you still think that this company is linked to the past sports equpiment industry then you’re wrong. You are investing in a new exchange platform such as Robinhood or IBKR. The closest equivalent to this would be Galaxy digital in the states.

Theres already confirmation of the transaction via multiple different sites. Just the 30Mil alone in Solana tokens puts this at $2.

1o16mg0,all,$KRKNF-  this is a micro cap stock worth watching,"KRKNF, the OTC-listed symbol for Kraken Robotics Inc., has drawn attention in recent months for its innovative work in marine technology and underwater robotics. The company specializes in high-resolution sonar and subsea intelligence systems, serving both defense and commercial sectors. As global interest in ocean mapping, naval modernization, and offshore energy grows, Kraken’s niche capabilities may position it to benefit from long-term trends in maritime infrastructure and security.

While KRKNF operates in a specialized market, its recent contracts and partnerships suggest a growing footprint. Investors tracking microcap equities with exposure to defense, robotics, or environmental monitoring may find Kraken’s developments worth monitoring. The company’s focus on scalable technology and international expansion could offer potential upside, though like all microcaps, it carries volatility and liquidity risks.

1o5hr2h,all,All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short report.,"MAJOR NEWS:

* After de-escalatory comments by Trump over the weekend, where he said ""don't worry about China, I think it will be one with China"", we pushed higher, trying to break above the 21d EMA.
* In the last hour, we have pared gains slightly on the following comments from Bessent, which was more aggressive than comments made by Trump previously. 
* BESSENT COMMENTS:
* US Tsy Sec Bessent On China Trade: Believe China Is Open To Discussion On This; If Not, We Have Substantial Levers We Can Pull
*  We Could Move More Aggressively Than China Has
*  Everything's On The Table
*  Confident This Can Be De-Escalated
*  China’s  exports jumped 8.3% in September to $328.6 billion, the fastest growth in six months and well above forecasts, per Bloomberg.  While shipments to the U.S. fell 27%, exports to non-U.S. markets surged 14.8%, led by the EU (+14%), ASEAN (+16%), Africa (+56%), and Latin America (+15%). 
*  (Shows China's leverage in the tariff dispute. They are still outperforming, GROWING experts, despite the 30% US tariffs that are currently imposed. The rest of the world is filling the gaps that US is leaving)

  
MAg7:

* TSLA - SHANGHAI GIGAFACTORY HAS BEGAN PRODUCTION RAMP-UP IN Q4
* AAPl - is close to acquiring talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, CNBC reports. 
* Tesla initiated with a Buy at Melius Research PT $520

OTHER COMPANIES:

* RARE EARTHS: The Pentagon is planning to stockpile up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals amid rising tensions with China, according to Financial Times.  Public filings show planned purchases include $500 million of cobalt, $245 million of antimony, and $100 million of tantalum. 
* RARE EARTHS CONTINUE TO BE A MASSIVE PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. 
* JPMorgan is launching a $1.5 trillion financing initiative over the next decade to back industries vital to U.S. national security and economic independence.
* IONQ - Said it achieved a breakthrough in quantum chemistry, showing its system can calculate atomic-level forces more accurately than classical methods.The study, done with a Global 1000 automaker, used IonQ’s QC-AFQMC algorithm to model nuclear forces for carbon-capture material design. 
* BE - Brookfield and Bloom Energy announced a $5 billion partnership to build global AI infrastructure facilities, with Bloom Energy serving as the preferred onsite power provider for Brookfield’s new AI factories.The deal marks Brookfield’s first investment under its AI Infrastructure strategy and will use Bloom’s fuel cell technology to power data centers requiring massive, always-on electricity capacity. The companies said a European site will be announced later this year.
* BYND - shares are tumbling after the company announced early results for its exchange offer of 0% Convertible Notes due 2027.
*  China's Xiaomi shares dropped more than 5% in Hong Kong after reports of a fatal SU7 crash in Chengdu, where the car’s doors reportedly failed to open after catching fire.  TXN -BofA downgrades to Underperform from neutral, lowers PT to 190 from 208. This downgrade report is in conjunction with our reassessment of our coverage cluster based on expected upside to our 12-month price objectives. While we continue to appreciate the high quality of TXN’s assets and its execution consistency, we believe the turmoil caused by global tariffs could limit any near- to medium-term demand improvement in the industrial economy.
* INTC - BofA downgrades INTC to underperform from neutral, maintains PT at 34.  We fundamentally disagree with valuation methods that rely on a sum-of-parts approach — applying P/E to INTC Products and P/S to INTC’s loss-making ‘Foundry’. The term ‘foundry’ is a misnomer since it implies great future potential to attract external customers, which we believe is unjustified. INTC relies on TSMC for approximately 30% of its manufacturing, with uncertainty about the cost and yield of its upcoming 18A process and future 14A process. Additionally, we believe U.S. government intervention requires INTC to remain committed to manufacturing, regardless of its profitability. All in, we believe INTC valuation should be based on P/E or EBITDA on earnings generated by the entire company, since there is no catalyst to split
* BofA gave coverage across the semi sector, upgrading AMAT, CAMT to buy, downgraded INTC and ACLS. 
* SFM - RBC capital upgrades to outperform from sector perform, lowers PT to 148 from 176. Since hitting a peak in June, SFM shares are down about 42%, underperforming grocery peers by roughly 31% and the market by about 54% over that period. With shares now trading at around 9x our 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate (\~15x P/E), we believe a comp deceleration on tough comparisons is already priced in, and concerns over recent promotional activity are overblown — creating a favorable risk/reward setup.
* JEF - defended its exposure to bankrupt auto-parts maker First Brands, saying potential losses are “manageable” and don’t threaten its financial health.
* CVLT - Piper Sandler upgrade sto overweight from Neutral, raises PT to 200 from 195. We are upgrading shares of CVLT from Neutral to Overweight and raising our price target to $200, following our recent checks, the recent pullback in shares over the last few weeks, and inputs gathered over the last few months across the space and Commvault specifically.  Overall, Commvault is a Generation-Z player in the backup and recovery space that is seeing durable demand trends given the shift away from the needs of the 'Modern Age.' Commvault is benefiting as its platform can address all of these new-generation needs in a flexible manner across consumption models.
* PYPL - Goldman Downgrades to Sell from neutral, sets PT at 70. We are downgrading shares of PYPL to Sell with a $70 price target. We believe PYPL faces several Transaction Margin headwinds next year, including: 1) continued interest rate headwinds; 2) lapping of the reacceleration of their credit products; and 3) the lapping of targeted repricing benefits in Braintree. Additionally, we see less line of sight for branded checkout re-acceleration in the near term given softer trends in Germany, tariff/de minimis-related disruptions in the U.S., and ongoing competition versus competing wallet form factors.  DATA CENTER NAMES: By 2030, U.S. AI data centers could use nearly 12% of America’s total power, up from just 3.7% in 2023, according to McKinsey.  That’s triple the share in 7 years, roughly 606 terawatt-hours of electricity, almost twice what the entire UK used in 2023.
* TSMC - TSMC keeps extending its lead. Its foundry market share has climbed from 63% in Q1 2024 to 71% in Q2 2025, while Samsung has slipped from 11% to 8%, according to Counterpoint. 
* PANW - Palo Alto Networks upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BTIG PT $248

OTHER NEWS:

* Gold - Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett said GOLD could climb to $6,000 by next spring if the current rally follows past bull market patterns. ""There are still very few long-term investors betting on gold.” Based on BofA data, gold represents only 0.5% of personal assets and 2.3% of institutional portfolios among clients, as of now.
* Elon Musk’s xAI is developing “world models,” advanced AI systems designed to understand and create physical environments, a step beyond text-based large language models like ChatGPT and Grok, per Financial Times.  To build them, xAI has hired former Nvidia specialists including Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, both with expertise in world modeling. The company plans to first apply the technology to gaming, using it to automatically generate interactive 3D environments, before expanding to robotics applications.

**What are the growth opportunities in this market?**

The rising number of teenagers and lack of knowledge about sexual health awareness have led to an increase in cases of HPV further stimulating the demand for the human papillomavirus vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mentions that approximately 64% of teen and pre-teen girls can be infected with HPV and 14 million of sexually active individuals will acquire HPV each year. Moreover, the rising trend of public-private partnership for vaccination initiatives and awareness campaigns further accelerates market growth.  
 

For example, according to UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership that helped by immunising children of a whole generation aiming to more than 84 million girls and prevention of approximately 1.4 million future deaths from cervical cancer. In India, the government launched its first HPV vaccine to enhance affordability and accessibility, aiming to immunize millions of adolescent girls across the country. This initiative is expected to reduce nearly 17% of all cancer deaths among Indian women. Additionally, the Alliance supported low- and middle-income countries to achieve higher HPV vaccine coverage, thus increasing the overall market.  
 

Moreover, the increasing prevalence of human papillomavirus in men and the shifting trend towards gender-neutral vaccination policies are contributing to market expansion. The CDC has recommended HPV vaccination for all individuals aged 11–12, with catch-up vaccinations up to age 26. Additionally, technological innovations are changing the landscape of HPV vaccine production such as advancements in recombinant DNA technology and virus-like particle platforms are leading to the development of next-generation [**vaccines**](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/vaccines-market) with broader coverage and longer protection durations. Emerging market players are focusing on local manufacturing capabilities for competitively priced vaccines, to meet growing demand across developing areas.  
 

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines market focused on the development, manufacturing, and distribution of vaccines that prevent infections caused by HPV.

1nzpc7r,all,7 AI Prompts That Will Uncover Your Hidden Competitive Advantages (C K Prahalad's Secrets Decoded),"I turned C.K. Prahalad's strategic thinking into ChatGPT prompts. These prompts are like having the master of core competencies and innovation as your personal strategy coach.

After reading ""Competing for the Future"" and ""The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid"" but still feeling stuck in incremental thinking, I realized I understood the frameworks but couldn't identify my own unique strategic advantages.

So I created AI prompts to systematically apply Prahalad's revolutionary concepts. Result? 

I discovered hidden capabilities I was underutilizing, pivoted my business toward future opportunities instead of fighting today's battles, and unlocked entirely new markets I'd previously ignored.

**1. The Core Competency Identifier (Strategic DNA Mapper)**
```
""I'm trying to differentiate my [BUSINESS/CAREER/PROJECT] in a competitive market. Using C.K. Prahalad's core competency framework: 1) What unique skills, technologies, or processes do I have that are difficult for competitors to replicate? 2) Which capabilities provide access to multiple markets or opportunities? 3) What do customers truly value that I deliver better than anyone else? 4) How can I leverage these core competencies into new product categories or services? Help me identify my strategic DNA - the 2-3 fundamental capabilities that should drive all my future growth.""
```

**2. The Future Market Architect (Opportunity Space Designer)**
```
""I'm focused on competing in today's market instead of creating tomorrow's opportunities. Apply Prahalad's 'competing for the future' mindset: 1) What emerging customer needs are invisible to my competitors? 2) How will technology, demographics, or regulations reshape my industry in 5-10 years? 3) What competencies must I start building now to dominate future markets? 4) How can I redefine my industry instead of just competing within it? Design a strategic roadmap that positions me for future opportunities rather than current battles.""
```

**3. The Bottom of the Pyramid Strategist (Untapped Market Discoverer)**
```
""I'm ignoring potential customers who [DESCRIBE UNDERSERVED SEGMENT] because conventional wisdom says they're not profitable. Using Prahalad's BOP approach: 1) How can I radically redesign my offering to serve this overlooked segment profitably? 2) What high-volume, low-margin models could unlock massive markets? 3) How do I create shared value that transforms communities while building sustainable business? 4) What partnerships or innovations make the 'impossible' market viable? Uncover hidden fortunes in markets everyone else dismisses.""
```

**4. The Strategic Intent Clarifier (Ambition Stretcher)**
```
""My goals feel incremental and uninspiring - they're based on current resources rather than ambitious vision. Help me create Prahalad's 'strategic intent': 1) What audacious but achievable position could I occupy in my industry? 2) How do I articulate a compelling future that motivates extraordinary effort? 3) What obsession should guide all my strategic decisions? 4) How can I create intentional resource imbalance that forces innovation? Transform my safe goals into stretch ambitions that create disproportionate success.""
```

**5. The Resource Leverage Expert (Capability Multiplier)**
```
""I keep thinking I need more resources when I should be maximizing what I already have. Apply Prahalad's resource leverage principles: 1) How can I access capabilities I don't own through partnerships and ecosystems? 2) What resources can I borrow, share, or combine in unique ways? 3) How do I extract 10x value from existing assets through creative recombination? 4) What 'resource blind spots' am I missing that are hiding in plain sight? Design a leverage strategy that multiplies impact without multiplying investment.""
```

**6. The Co-Creation Facilitator (Customer Innovation Partner)**
```
""I'm developing products in isolation instead of co-creating with customers. Using Prahalad's value co-creation approach: 1) How can I involve customers directly in designing experiences and solutions? 2) What platforms or processes enable continuous customer collaboration? 3) How do I shift from selling products to orchestrating personalized experiences? 4) What data and interaction systems create unique value through co-creation? Transform my business from provider to platform where customers become innovation partners.""
```

**7. The Industry Foresight Builder (Blind Spot Eliminator)**
```
""I'm so focused on current operations that I'm missing strategic shifts happening around me. Apply Prahalad's industry foresight methodology: 1) What discontinuities (technological, regulatory, social) could reshape my competitive landscape? 2) Which weak signals today could become dominant trends tomorrow? 3) What assumptions about my industry are becoming obsolete? 4) How do I build organizational radar that spots opportunities before competitors? Create an early-warning system that turns uncertainty into strategic advantage.""
```

**PRAHALAD'S GOLDEN PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER:**

- **Core competencies are the roots of competitive advantage** - Surface products change, deep capabilities endure  
- **Compete for the future, not just today** - Tomorrow's opportunities matter more than today's market share
- **Find fortunes in overlooked markets** - The biggest opportunities hide where others refuse to look
- **Strategic intent creates extraordinary effort** - Stretch goals unlock hidden capabilities
- **Leverage resources you don't own** - Access matters more than ownership
- **Co-create value with customers** - Innovation happens through collaboration, not isolation

**THE PRAHALAD MINDSET SHIFT:**

Before every strategic decision, ask: 

> ""What unique capabilities can I leverage for future opportunities? How can I create value in markets everyone else is ignoring? What would an audaciously successful future look like?""

P.S. - The biggest revelation: Most businesses fail not from lack of resources but from lack of strategic imagination. The future belongs to those who can see opportunities invisible to competitors and leverage capabilities in ways others haven't imagined.

* AAPl - is close to acquiring talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, CNBC reports. 
* Tesla initiated with a Buy at Melius Research PT $520

OTHER COMPANIES:

* RARE EARTHS: The Pentagon is planning to stockpile up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals amid rising tensions with China, according to Financial Times.  Public filings show planned purchases include $500 million of cobalt, $245 million of antimony, and $100 million of tantalum. 
* RARE EARTHS CONTINUE TO BE A MASSIVE PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. 
* JPMorgan is launching a $1.5 trillion financing initiative over the next decade to back industries vital to U.S. national security and economic independence.
* IONQ - Said it achieved a breakthrough in quantum chemistry, showing its system can calculate atomic-level forces more accurately than classical methods.The study, done with a Global 1000 automaker, used IonQ’s QC-AFQMC algorithm to model nuclear forces for carbon-capture material design. 
* BE - Brookfield and Bloom Energy announced a $5 billion partnership to build global AI infrastructure facilities, with Bloom Energy serving as the preferred onsite power provider for Brookfield’s new AI factories.The deal marks Brookfield’s first investment under its AI Infrastructure strategy and will use Bloom’s fuel cell technology to power data centers requiring massive, always-on electricity capacity.

TXN -BofA downgrades to Underperform from neutral, lowers PT to 190 from 208. This downgrade report is in conjunction with our reassessment of our coverage cluster based on expected upside to our 12-month price objectives. While we continue to appreciate the high quality of TXN’s assets and its execution consistency, we believe the turmoil caused by global tariffs could limit any near- to medium-term demand improvement in the industrial economy.
* INTC - BofA downgrades INTC to underperform from neutral, maintains PT at 34.  We fundamentally disagree with valuation methods that rely on a sum-of-parts approach — applying P/E to INTC Products and P/S to INTC’s loss-making ‘Foundry’. The term ‘foundry’ is a misnomer since it implies great future potential to attract external customers, which we believe is unjustified. INTC relies on TSMC for approximately 30% of its manufacturing, with uncertainty about the cost and yield of its upcoming 18A process and future 14A process. Additionally, we believe U.S. government intervention requires INTC to remain committed to manufacturing, regardless of its profitability. All in, we believe INTC valuation should be based on P/E or EBITDA on earnings generated by the entire company, since there is no catalyst to split
* BofA gave coverage across the semi sector, upgrading AMAT, CAMT to buy, downgraded INTC and ACLS. 
* SFM - RBC capital upgrades to outperform from sector perform, lowers PT to 148 from 176. Since hitting a peak in June, SFM shares are down about 42%, underperforming grocery peers by roughly 31% and the market by about 54% over that period. With shares now trading at around 9x our 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate (\~15x P/E), we believe a comp deceleration on tough comparisons is already priced in, and concerns over recent promotional activity are overblown — creating a favorable risk/reward setup.
* JEF - defended its exposure to bankrupt auto-parts maker First Brands, saying potential losses are “manageable” and don’t threaten its financial health.
* CVLT - Piper Sandler upgrade sto overweight from Neutral, raises PT to 200 from 195. We are upgrading shares of CVLT from Neutral to Overweight and raising our price target to $200, following our recent checks, the recent pullback in shares over the last few weeks, and inputs gathered over the last few months across the space and Commvault specifically.  Overall, Commvault is a Generation-Z player in the backup and recovery space that is seeing durable demand trends given the shift away from the needs of the 'Modern Age.' Commvault is benefiting as its platform can address all of these new-generation needs in a flexible manner across consumption models.
* PYPL - Goldman Downgrades to Sell from neutral, sets PT at 70. We are downgrading shares of PYPL to Sell with a $70 price target. We believe PYPL faces several Transaction Margin headwinds next year, including: 1) continued interest rate headwinds; 2) lapping of the reacceleration of their credit products; and 3) the lapping of targeted repricing benefits in Braintree. Additionally, we see less line of sight for branded checkout re-acceleration in the near term given softer trends in Germany, tariff/de minimis-related disruptions in the U.S., and ongoing competition versus competing wallet form factors.  DATA CENTER NAMES: By 2030, U.S. AI data centers could use nearly 12% of America’s total power, up from just 3.7% in 2023, according to McKinsey.  That’s triple the share in 7 years, roughly 606 terawatt-hours of electricity, almost twice what the entire UK used in 2023.
* TSMC - TSMC keeps extending its lead. Its foundry market share has climbed from 63% in Q1 2024 to 71% in Q2 2025, while Samsung has slipped from 11% to 8%, according to Counterpoint. 
* PANW - Palo Alto Networks upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BTIG PT $248

OTHER NEWS:

* Gold - Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett said GOLD could climb to $6,000 by next spring if the current rally follows past bull market patterns.

1o2kr5r,all,"Pro-Russian Hacktivists Shift Focus to Critical Infrastructure, Attack Decoy Water Treatment Plant","
**The hacktivist group TwoNet targets critical infrastructure, attacking a decoy water treatment system in a significant shift from DDoS tactics.**

**Key Points:**

- TwoNet transitioned from DDoS attacks to targeting critical infrastructure within a year.
- The attack on a decoy water facility occurred within 26 hours, involving initial access and disruptive actions.
- Forescout researchers monitored the situation and found that the group exploited an old XSS vulnerability.
- TwoNet's activities indicate a broader strategy to compromise SCADA systems in perceived enemy nations.
- Organizations in critical infrastructure are urged to enhance authentication and network segmentation to mitigate risks.

The pro-Russian hacktivist group known as TwoNet has taken alarming steps to escalate its cyber activities by targeting critical infrastructure, as demonstrated by its recent attack on a decoy water treatment facility. Initially, the group focused on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against entities that supported Ukraine, but they have now pivoted to more sophisticated tactics. Forescout's monitoring revealed that within 26 hours of breaching the system, TwoNet attempted to disrupt operations and disable logs, indicating a clear intention to cause damage rather than merely deface or disrupt services. 

In this instance, researchers observed the group leveraging default credentials to gain initial access and exploiting a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability to announce their presence. Rather than escalating privileges or breaching deeper into the system architecture, they targeted the web application layer, revealing an alarming trend among hacktivist groups moving towards operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) attacks. Forescout has called for heightened security measures in critical infrastructure sectors, urging organizations to implement robust authentication measures and effective network segmentation to better defend against these evolving threats.

How can organizations in critical infrastructure better prepare for potential cyber threats from hacktivist groups like TwoNet?

1o45yh8,all,The coming Bitcoin Crash: How Global Elites Are Engineering Bitcoin's Demise to Usher in Digital Slavery,"The dirty secret of cryptocurrency investing that nobody wants to admit is that 99% of people who buy Bitcoin aren't interested in using it as currency or supporting some technological revolution. They're participating in what economists call the ""greater fool theory""—the belief that they can buy an asset at today's price because there will always be someone else (a greater fool) willing to buy it from them at a higher price tomorrow.

This psychological vulnerability—the universal ""cash-out mentality""—is the precise pressure point that will be exploited to trigger the coming collapse. When every investor is secretly planning their exit strategy, you have the perfect conditions for a stampede.

Part 1: The Setup—Weaponizing the Cash-Out Mentality

The entire cryptocurrency ecosystem has been structured to maximize this cash-out psychology:

The Greater Fool Ecosystem

· Social media ""influencers"" constantly hyping the next price target
· Trading platforms designed like casinos with leverage and derivatives
· Mainstream financial media treating crypto like a spectator sport
· The entire narrative focused on price appreciation, not utility

The Institutional Trap
When BlackRock and other institutions entered the space,they didn't just bring legitimacy—they became the ultimate ""greater fools."" Retail investors felt secure knowing these giants were in the game, believing they would always have someone to sell to.

The cruel irony? These institutions are positioned to exit first, leaving retail investors as the actual greater fools holding worthless digital tokens.

Part 2: The Trigger Events—Engineering the Panic

The collapse will be triggered by seemingly unrelated events that create the perfect cover for coordinated whale selling:

Plausible Deniability Catalysts

1. The ""Black Swan"" Geopolitical Event
   · A major war escalation that triggers global market panic
   · A sovereign debt crisis involving a major economy
   · Coordinated terrorist attacks on financial infrastructure
     These events provide the perfect smoke screen for whales to begin dumping their holdings while blaming ""macroeconomic conditions.""
2. The ""Trusted"" Institution Failure
   · A major, ""too-big-to-fail"" crypto exchange suddenly halting withdrawals
   · A stablecoin unexpectedly breaking its peg despite previous assurances
   · A regulated ETF provider facing unexpected liquidity issues
     Each failure will be framed as an isolated incident while triggering cascading fear.
3. The Regulatory ""Surprise""
   · Unexpected legislation from a major economy restricting crypto transactions
   · A coordinated G20 announcement about cryptocurrency risks
   · Major banking institutions suddenly severing ties with crypto companies
     The timing will be perfect to maximize panic.

The Whale Coordination Mechanism
The~2,000 wallets controlling 40% of Bitcoin won't dump simultaneously. Instead, they'll execute a carefully choreographed sequence:

· Phase 1: Small, strategic sells to test market depth
· Phase 2: Increasing volume while maintaining plausible deniability
· Phase 3: Coordinated large sells triggering algorithmic stop-losses
· Phase 4: Maximum panic as retail investors scramble to exit

Part 3: The Psychological Warfare—Turning Greed Into Fear

The cash-out mentality that drove people into crypto will be the same instinct that destroys them:

The Narrative Flip
Media outlets that once celebrated crypto millionaires will suddenly feature:

· Families who lost their life savings
· Former enthusiasts now describing crypto as a ""cult""
· Experts declaring ""we told you so""
· Investigations into ""predatory"" crypto marketing

The Social Media Amplification
The same influencers who drove the hype will now drive the panic:

· ""I'm getting out while I still can"" posts going viral
· Urgent ""sell signals"" from previously bullish analysts
· Conspiracy theories about market manipulation creating additional fear
· Hashtags like #CryptoCollapse trending globally

Part 4: The Domino Effect—When Everyone Wants Out at Once

The tragedy of the cash-out mentality is that it only works when most people don't act on it simultaneously. The engineered collapse will ensure everyone tries to exit at the same moment:

The Liquidity Black Hole

· Exchanges will experience trading volumes they cannot handle
· Withdrawal requests will exceed available liquid funds
· ""Technical issues"" and ""scheduled maintenance"" will appear
· The very infrastructure that enabled the boom will ensure the bust

The Realization Dawns
Investors will discover the brutal truth:you can only cash out if someone else is willing to buy. When the greater fools disappear, the music stops and there aren't enough chairs for everyone.

Part 5: The Historical Pattern—We've Seen This Movie Before

This isn't the first time the cash-out mentality has been weaponized:

The 1929 Parallel

· Margin trading and ""everyone can get rich"" mentality
· The establishment profiting on both the way up and way down
· The collapse being used to justify massive new regulations

*The 2008 Echo

· Complex financial products nobody understood
· Ratings agencies providing false confidence
· The same institutions that created the crisis profiting from it

The pattern is clear: let the masses believe they've found a shortcut to wealth, then pull the rug out and use the carnage to justify greater control.

Conclusion: The Trap Springs Shut

When the collapse comes, it will feel inevitable in retrospect. The signs were there all along:

· An asset with little practical utility whose value depended entirely on greater fools
· Institutions positioning themselves to exit first
· A regulatory environment designed to fail at the crucial moment
· A psychological setup ensuring panic would spread like wildfire

The cruelest joke? The very people who thought they were gaming the system will discover they were the ones being played. Their dreams of cashing out will transform into nightmares of being trapped in a collapsing market.

And in the aftermath, the solution will be presented: Central Bank Digital Currencies that promise stability and protection. The masses, traumatized by their crypto experience, will eagerly embrace their new digital cages—never realizing they were herded into them through a carefully orchestrated collapse.

The question isn't whether you'll want to cash out—it's whether you'll be able to when everyone else is trying to do the same thing at exactly the same time.

Following an engineered financial collapse, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will not vanish but will be deliberately marginalized, transformed from a revolutionary movement into a mere digital artifact. The establishment will allow crypto to persist in a tightly controlled manner—similar to how amateur radio exists alongside modern telecommunications—serving as a permanent warning rather than a practical alternative. Prices will stabilize at a small fraction of their peak, high enough to wipe out leveraged investors and institutional interest but low enough to remove any threat as a store of value. Major exchanges will either fail or become so heavily regulated that they function as extensions of the traditional banking system, requiring complete identity verification and transaction monitoring that nullifies cryptocurrency’s original promise of financial privacy. The narrative will permanently shift from ""digital gold"" to a speculative relic, studied in economics classes as another example of technological promise undermined by human nature. This managed decline serves a crucial purpose: cryptocurrency remains visible enough to justify the ""necessity"" of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), yet powerless to challenge the emerging financial control grid. The revolution won’t be outlawed—it will be neutered and preserved as a museum piece, demonstrating the futility of challenging monetary sovereignty.

History shows that those who create alternative monetary systems outside established power structures often face dire consequences. President John F. Kennedy attempted to issue silver-backed currency through the U.S. Treasury, bypassing the Federal Reserve, only to be assassinated months later with his policy quickly reversed. Abraham Lincoln’s ""Greenbacks""—debt-free government currency created during the Civil War—challenged banking interests, and he was killed shortly after the war. More recently, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s plan for a gold-backed African dinar to liberate the continent from dollar dominance preceded his overthrow and execution in a NATO-led operation. These examples reveal that monetary independence poses the ultimate threat to established power. However, the modern approach has evolved from overt confrontation to sophisticated co-option. Rather than repeating dramatic interventions, today’s power structures embrace and control emerging monetary technologies like Bitcoin. By regulating rather than banning cryptocurrencies, they avoid creating martyrs while gaining crucial intelligence and management over the system’s growth and eventual crisis. This represents centuries of refined strategy: neutralizing monetary threats not through forceful opposition that sparks resistance, but through patient co-option that transforms dangers into controlled assets.",Dependent_Pumpkin997,2025-10-12 02:00:32,10,0.66,5,15,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/conspiracy/comments/1o45yh8/the_coming_bitcoin_crash_how_global_elites_are/,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1o45yh8/the_coming_bitcoin_crash_how_global_elites_are/,self.conspiracy,0,,,0,none,[],9314,104,,trending technology,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o54gkc,all,Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade Fight Night: The morning after and a sepcial one-year retrospective.,"https://preview.redd.it/qr54c86t8ruf1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7ee2860eb5914fb2a429aaf3df1a18d36da3126

Unfortunately, last night's Fight Night event resulted in perhaps the worst turnout I've seen since about a year doing these. I was filled with hope that tonight was going to be very busy since I matched up with a player from the Round1 location in Tukwilla, WA almost right off the bat after maintenance ended, but it became a trudge soon after.

Four hours passed and I was only able to match against two other players. One from Tukwilla, WA and the other from the Round1 location at the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets in Las Vegas, NV. Whatever the case was, out of 42 locations in the US that have Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade available, and out of the 80+ cabinets available out at these locations, hardly any had anyone playing them last night. 

For those reading this, I would advise not to get too discouraged. In my time playing Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade, I've had many good nights. I document my matchups with a GoPro and, back in August, I ended up with 30+ matches. 

On another note, this month marks one full year since I've taken it upon myself to build a community of Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade players, and I'd like to take a moment to talk about that.

https://preview.redd.it/6pka4hmlhruf1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=66c92808179ff05996063a1298e5c4ff09d8f060

I had been aware of Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade's planned existence as far back as December 2022 when it was officially announced. I was certainly happy that Capcom would at least lend it's game to arcade game developer, Taito, to keep the long-running tradition going. However, it seemed like the only way that an English-speaking American like me would be able to enjoy it was by going to Japan and, seeing as I'm not clever enough to get a company to routinely pay for my way out there, this act would require a commitment of several thousand dollars each time I did so. That's hard to do for most people.

However, when the game did get released in December of 2023, I didn't know that Round1 Bowling & Arcade would be bringing the title to the US at their locations. How could I know? They practically did zero advertising for it. Although reports started to flood in here and there about SF6 cabinets being available in the US, I wasn't aware until roughly September of 2024. By happenstance, I discovered that there was a cabinet that was in somewhat reasonable driving distance to where I lived.   
  
When I made this discovery, I sat aside an entire Friday to go out there and explore and study the game, and I ended up learning so many cool aspects about it. I learned about how you could face off against other arcade players, how you can create an account and setup a profile on it, and how you could use costumes purchased on the home version on the arcade machine. It was clear to me that the game was designed as a sort of extracirricular activity for players of the home version. Most importantly, however, this was perhaps the most viable and exciting way for me to personally relive the days of going to an arcade and testing my skills outside of home against others who were also bold enough to also go out to the arcade.

Yes, I know that I can test my skills with strangers with the home version with online multiplayer. I know that I don't have to leave my home or spend additional money on gas, food, and credits in order to do these things. Going out and playing Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade for over a year now has brought me face to face with the reasons why arcades have died in the US. The purpose of coin-operated video game arcades of the past had been subsumed by the growing American trend of being able to do everything you want and need from home. Much like with shopping, working, and consuming other forms of entertainment, playing video games outside your home became less and less viable once technology got to a certain point. Now, apart from trying to relive glory days or engrossing yourself in a niche hobby, there's pretty much no real reason to leave your house to enjoy video games.

However, it was still something that I enjoyed, and I was thankful that I still got to enjoy it with a video game that I was actively playing at both at home and at tournaments. More to the point, playing against others made me aware that I wasn't the only one that also had the same appreciation for the experience, but there were no resources for us to communicate and find each other, nor were there resources to help others be able to find where they could go in order to play Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade because not every Round1 location had them. I tried first going through the company to see if they had any list of locations that had it, but every time I would leave them contact info to get back with me, they never did. 

In the absence of these things, I took it upon myself to fill that void. I created first a Facebook Group, then a Discord server for those who played Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade. I authored an extensive and regularly-updated guide to help people learn how to get the most out of their experience playing the game, and I also created an online map that lists out all the known locations of where Street Fighter 6 Type Arcade is in the US. Since I never could get Round1 to send me a list of all locations that had the game, I literally called every single location in the US and simply asked the employee who answered the phone whether they had the game or not. The process took at least two nights to accomplish.

All-in-all, I've done a lot to try and foster a community of Street Fighter 6 players who like to play the arcade version. By doing so, I feel like I've lead to players having better nights matching up with others at the Round1 arcades here in the US and created a better experience overall, both for those who were already playiing it and those who learned about it and sought it out because of my efforts. I plan to continue fostering the community and keeping things as updated as possible.

I certainly hope that my efforts have given people a fun and exciting way of enjoying Street Fighter 6 that they wouldn't have otherwise had been aware of, and I certainly hope that you had fun.

1o0tcy0,all,Decades That Stand The Test of Time (USA),"I will mention decades that were heavily discussed and live on in pop culture and the media.

* 1920s
* 1950s
* 1980s
* 2000s

**1920s** ***The Roaring Twenties***

The 1920s are often romanticized as a time of economic prosperity (before the Great Depression hit), cultural innovation, and social change. Think of the flapper style, jazz music, and the rebellious spirit that defined the decade. The 1920s also saw the rise of Hollywood and the global influence of American culture. Even nearly a century later, the decade's bold fashion and larger-than-life characters still inspire modern pop culture, from *The Great Gatsby* to period films like *Babylon*.

**Why it stands the test of time**: The 1920s marked a pivotal cultural shift. It was a time of breaking away from old traditions and embracing new freedoms. The influence of jazz, the birth of the ""modern woman,"" and the explosion of creative art and expression laid the foundation for much of the culture we know today.

**The 1950s - The Post-War Boom**

The 1950s are often seen as the idealized ""Leave It to Beaver"" era, filled with suburban life, rock ‘n roll, and the dawn of modern consumerism. It was also the beginning of the civil rights movement, with figures like Rosa Parks challenging the status quo. Iconic pop culture figures like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean helped define the decade's aesthetics and energy. The 1950s started what we define as ""cool"" and an influence of teen and early 20s aged young adult culture, something teens still try to do today being ""cool"" and fitting in. The 1950s mixed both futurism with the present and was overall polished and stylish.

**Why it stands the test of time**: The 1950s were a time of optimism, growth, and cultural clashes. The decade's fashion, music, and iconic TV shows (like *I Love Lucy* and *The Twilight Zone*) still feel nostalgic to this day, symbolizing both innocence and the prosperity of modern American society at the time. This decade also has the most collectible cars for car enthusiasts that spend high prices for them.

**The 1980s - The Age of Prosperity and Innovation**

The 1980s were defined by innovative fashion choices, the rise of personal computers, the explosion of MTV, and an ever-present sense of optimism. Think neon colors, pop music, and some of the most memorable blockbuster movies of all time, like *E.T.*, *Back to the Future*, and *Ghostbusters*. Politically, it was the era of Reagan, but the cultural legacy of the 1980s is marked by a sense of fun, rebellion, and new technology.

**Why it stands the test of time**: The 1980s were a formative decade for both technology and pop culture. The music, movies, and fashion have become iconic, and the era’s creativity and boldness are still embraced today in everything from fashion trends to music. Plus, the 1980s are often remembered as a time when the future felt both exciting and uncertain, a feeling that resonates in our modern tech-driven age.

**The 2000s - The Digital Revolution and the Birth of the Internet Age**

The 2000s were a transformative time. The internet, social media, and mobile phones began to shape how we communicate and interact with the world. It was the decade that brought us *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and the rise of reality TV. Fashion was marked by a blend of Y2K aesthetics, low-rise jeans, wild spikey sloppy high hair, and ""emo"" influences. Politically, the aftermath of 9/11 shaped much of the decade's outlook. The sexual revolution was still going on, and it more people were more relaxed about things in general.

**Why it stands the test of time**: The 2000s were the bridge between the analog and digital worlds. It was the decade that brought us the mainstreaming of the internet, social media, and the beginnings of the streaming revolution. The cultural and technological shifts that began then have fundamentally reshaped our lives today, and many of us still carry pieces of that era with us (whether it’s our love for *Malcolm in the Middle* or *iPods*).

**Honorable mentions**

* **1960s** \- while not a prosperous time due to war, protests, and political polarization, the 1960s transformed much of America in only a few years. Things changed so rapidly in a small amount of time. Even a movie like American Graffiti depicted life in 1962 accurately yet in reality the movie was made in 1973 (only 11 years later) but so much was different by then. Although it was a hostile and divided decade, The 1960s was arguably the most progressive decade in the 20th century. It was also a time that casual sex became common by the late 1960s and less people started getting married, but living together instead if they were in long term relationships. People began to be more relaxed about casual dating as well. This was the first time we saw an interracial couple on TV or in the movies and when married people shared the same bed, before then they were depicted as sleeping in separate twin beds. So we became more casual about adulthood and relaxed on it.
* **1990s -** marked by both progress and challenging. On the positive side, the rise of the internet, the dot-com boom, and the widespread use of personal computers set the stage for the digital age, but that was mostly in the last 3 years of the decade. TV shows like *Seinfeld,* and *Friends*, and blockbuster films. Economically, the country experienced a period of growth and relative prosperity under the Clinton administration. However, the decade was also marked by growing economic inequality, the aftermath of the Gulf War, and rising concerns over the opioid crisis and mental health. It was a time of some optimism and change but also of had many unresolved social and political issues. However there was a surplus during the late 1990s,  things were going well for most Americans. This was also another decade that was continuing the trend of sexual liberation and much of the mindset of the late 1960s/early 1970s ""experimental"" situations in sex and intimacy.

That is the perspective for the USA though....what were the best decades in YOUR country?

1nzo756,all,Airship AI Announces $11.0 Million of Firm Fixed Price Brand Name,"REDMOND, Wash., Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Airship AI Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AISP) (“Airship AI” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, today announced it has been awarded 16 individual contracts from agencies within the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for Airship’s AI driven technical solutions supporting public safety and investigative requirements.

“These awards reflect the continued momentum and critical importance of AI-driven surveillance solutions in advancing public safety and homeland security,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “As the administration prioritizes strengthening national security, AI is proving to be an essential force multiplier for law enforcement, delivering greater operational efficiency, enhanced accuracy, and improved threat detection, particularly along the border.”

Airship AI delivers a full spectrum of solutions, ranging from advanced analytics at the edge to datacenter and cloud-based AI capabilities. By aggregating thousands of edge-generated feeds into a unified “single pane of glass,” Airship AI provides real-time alerts on suspicious activity and events at both regional and national scales. These capabilities enable agencies to maximize existing resources, with AI serving as the first set of eyes, automatically detecting potential threats so operators can focus attention where it is needed most.

At the core of these capabilities is Outpost AI\*\*,\*\* Airship AI’s advanced edge-based appliance. Outpost AI leverages proprietary, in-house trained models to detect a wide range of user-defined objects and events. Its integrated rule engine allows agencies to predefine autonomous actions, such as automatically tracking an item of interest, without requiring constant human oversight. With a compact form factor and minimal power requirements, Outpost AI is seamlessly integrated into both new and existing systems, transforming traditional sensor packages into intelligent, autonomous solutions at a fraction of the cost of full replacement.

“These recent awards not only reinforce and expand our existing deployed capabilities but also open the door to significant new requirements where Airship AI's solution stack has clearly demonstrated its ability to address additional agency challenges,” continued Mr. Allen. “In one case, following several successful pilot deployments that replaced underperforming competitive systems, our platform was adopted as the preferred solution for all future related infrastructure requirements.”

**Mr. Allen added, “Beyond these awards, we are actively pursuing a large number of opportunities whose funding shifted from the fourth quarter into the first quarter of the government’s fiscal year, as well as new opportunities that emerged in the third quarter, opportunities that will further expand Airship AI's footprint supporting mission critical operations across the federal law enforcement community.”**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/PNMITc3eyA)  **Nov 28, 2016**

My daughter uses Reddit and is helping me type this today. I am at loss in what to do in this situation. 


My wife's aunt became a window two years ago. She came to live with us because she was afraid of staying alone. Since we had extra rooms and that she was perfectly healthy and fine, we decided it was okay to let her stay with us. 

Over time she grew more and more attached to my wife. She wouldn't want her to go to work because she'd miss her, she didn't want her to go shopping because it was always too long, she would follow her to parties and events even if she didn't want to go because she didn't want to be without her. I told my wife that it was becoming unhealthy and that her aunt should talk more to her friends and try to meet with them ( she has a couple friends around her age). My wife always told me that I was exaggerating and that there was nothing wrong. 

Recently, 6 months ago or so, the aunt caught a bronchitis and then another viral infection and some type of spine pain. She became very dependent on us to move her. That's when things started going really bad. She required my wife's attention almost 24/7 and would cry when my wife wasn't around. She wanted my wife to sleep next to her, feed her, talk to her constantly, not go out, not go to work, etc. 

After a week I complained to my wife about not spending any time with her and that her aunt was taking ALL of her. My wife dismissed my worries and told me that she would get better soon. After two months of her aunt acting like a baby and constantly complaining about pain, I suggested we go consult. The doctor said she was perfectly fine, nothing wrong. We had trouble believing it so we consulted different specialists and they ultimately said that if she keeps up her good health, she'd could live another 10-15 years. We met with a psychologist and he said that the aunt needs more tests to determine what she has but that my wife and I clearly need to focus on us and not her her aunt affect our marriage. 

Since I am retired, I told my wife that we should finally go take THE vacations we always wanted. I booked tickets to go on a cruise around Alaska. I even planned everything and asked my daughter [35F] to take care of her aunt. A week before going, I couldn't keep the secret anymore and told my wife what I had done. My wife was clearly happy and amazed. I finally thought we could have some alone good time. When she let her aunt know later that night it was a major catastrophe. The aunt cried, threw tantrums, called all her friends to let her know how awful we were to leave her ""alone"", she even threw herself on the ground. 

I told my wife it was time to put her in a home for elders and that she couldn't stay with us anymore. My wife refused. She said she wasn't going to abandon her and that it's hard to be old. She also cancelled our vacations and said she's sure I'd understand. It hurt me, a lot. I did end up going with my daughter instead and we had a great time, but that's besides the point. 

Now, we are selling our house. It's too big for us. The aunt has a say in all this... She requires a room with specific details such as dimensions, views, number of stairs to come into the house, etc. My wife is actually listening to her and it is making me more and more unhappy. I retired to spend time with her, our kids and our grandkids but it feels like she's only spending time with her aunt. 

We are in couple counselling, it is not helping us, I have been married to her for almost 45 years, I don't want to give her an ultimatum as she is the love of my life and I certainly don't ever want to be without her. I just want to spend quality time with her. 

 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My wife's aunt is living with us, she grew attached to my wife and doesn't want to let her go anywhere including on vacation with me. My wife sides with her. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**PETE_TRON**

>Is your wife willing to ruin your retirement and marriage for her aunt? You need to issue the ultimatum as this isn't fair to you or her. Would getting professional care to look after her in your home be an option, instead of sending her to a nursing home?

**OOP**

>>We found this lovely lady who would come and take care of the aunt a couple hours a day. She speaks the same language and is has over 25 years of experience. My wife refused saying she is a stranger and that if we need to pay someone then we should do it ourselves and keep the money. 

**~**

**stuckhans**

>I would just start taking the trips without her.  Maybe she'll notice.  

**OOP**

>>I took that trip without her. It was her dream trip. She did say that she wished she could have gone but that was it. I think she feels like her aunt is her duty, kind of like when you have children. 

**~**

**jpallan**

> Is your wife of another ethnic or cultural background?  Sometimes, that plays into the situation.  And if her family, speaking the non-local language, is used to relying upon one another, going to an outsider might seem even more difficult, no matter how qualified and caring.
>
> I'm in my thirties and my husband and I are caring for my aged widowed father in conjunction with all of my four siblings and paid caretakers, by switching off days and weekends.  It's really hard stuff and very frustrating.
>
> You don't mention where you're from (though since you mentioned cruising Alaska I'm guessing you're in North America), but in the States, if someone is still competent to make their own decisions, *i.e.* doesn't have dementia, you *can't* put them in care against their will.  It complicates things.
>
> You've been married to your wife for a very long time, so I would reach out to her and tell her that you want to make this situation as easy as possible for her, for the aunt, *and* for you.  Find out the elder care laws.  Find out what the requirements are to keep the aunt in her own home or yours.  There are charitable groups that will do regular visits or agencies to offer respite care.  There are adult daycare centers.
>
> I don't know what the compromise is here.  My husband and I don't, either.  

**OOP**

>>You're right. My wife used to take care of her mom who took care of her mom... It seems to be very cultural. The aunt has been living in America for 50 years but never did any effort to learn English, she only speaks her native language which really complicates things. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/LcXJAKV34G)  **Dec 23, 2016 (1 month later)**

Something completely magical happened. My wife and I were looking at a house we both actually love. It has every single thing we waned in our retirement home and it's close to everything that we need. We were thrilled and when she told her aunt and showed her the pictures of the house her aunt laughed and said ""You can't buy that, it has stairs! I can't go up and down the stairs!"" 

Something clicked in my wife's mind. She simply said to her aunt, it's the house that my husband and I like and the fact that it has some stairs that you are healthy enough to go up and down on won't stop us. Her aunt cried and cried. We called our (new) therapist which suggested that we treat her like a child, check on her every 15 minutes but not give in. We did that and she got over it by the next morning. 

My wife also got more ""tough love"" with her aunt and whenever she'll complain about stuff my wife knows are unreal my wife dismisses it politely. 

Things aren't 100% perfect, the new therapist helped my wife a lot, she mainly focused on her and why my wife was feeling the almost nurturing need to be there for her aunt. 

Thank you /r/relationships for the advice, changing therapists was a great idea, I don't know if I have had the courage to just follow through without you but I did the very next day. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Changed therapist, wife realized a lot of things about herself and is now less worried about her aunt and more focused on us.

1o3ux3a,all,UB is an ad.,"People's enjoyment of UB has really seemed to depend on how well each set is designed and how individually familiar you are with the IP being featured. 

But I almost never see anyone talking about the fact that **Universes Beyond is an advertisement.**

Remember when Disney put Star Wars characters on oranges at the grocery store and it went viral because it just seemed gross in a way that felt hard to put a finger on? Like it was just… too much? That’s exactly what Hasbro is doing to our game.

Hasbro is advertising Magic to TMNT fans and advertising TMNT to Magic fans. They're choosing to do this *inside the game we love*, and somehow people are just fine with it.

If a Harry Potter sequel movie came out with characters from Squid Game as main characters just to promote the new season, Harry Potter fans would be justifiably furious. Squid Game fans probably wouldn't be too happy either. These crossover characters add nothing to the story of Magic and nothing meaningful to the game. Just a quick sugar rush of seeing your favorite character's defining features translated into Magic mechanics.

I used to think I'd be okay with an IP I loved being represented in Magic, but I don't feel that way anymore. Hasbro has crossed a line. They're tattooing advertisements on our faces, and they know that not only will we take it, but if it's an ad for something we like, we'll actually *thank them* for it.

Magic isn't Monopoly. You can't just keep releasing different editions with different IPs slapped on and expect the integrity of the game to remain intact. 

**We need to stop the madness.** No matter how good the card design is or how much you personally like an IP, Magic The Gathering deserves a legacy better than to be turned into an ad platform for whatever franchise Hasbro can cut an ad deal with next. Join me in calling UB what it actually is: Advertisements Beyond. And let's buy the oranges without Star Wars ads on them.",BraneFreeze,2025-10-11 18:24:49,2623,0.83,800,3423,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/magicTCG/comments/1o3ux3a/ub_is_an_ad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1o3ux3a/ub_is_an_ad/,self.magicTCG,0,Universes Beyond - Discussion,,0,none,[],1952,12,,viral,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o1g89s,all,I hate that writers have to sell themselves on social media too,"I’m so tired. Just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

I‘ve published thirteen speculative fiction books with a small indie press over the past decade. They had a pretty good reception. Got some awards. Made some money. One or two nice write-ups. The royalties aren’t enough to live on alone, but my partner and I got by.

Now, it feels like readers demand social media activity on TikTok/Instagram/whatever. I feel like I’m selling myself as a brand, almost like a streamer, instead of letting my work speak for itself.

A number of my friends in the industry are much more comfortable doing this. They’re really good at it. I envy them and hate myself for not being able to do the same.

Now that I’m querying agents to break into the traditional side of the industry, I seem to be falling even further behind. I’ve had lots of full requests, but no contract yet. Sometimes I wish I’d go viral on Tiktok, so I could earn enough to be patient/attract interest from the right agent. But most of the time I just get sick when I open social media.

The majority of my sales are through word of mouth anyway, and I’m so grateful for my readers. They get it. But to find new readers outside of personal recs, I feel like a performing monkey saying “Look at me! I write sapphic romance!”

Just wishing I could move to a cabin in the woods and write like a hermit, shipping two books a year to my agent/publisher. Sadly, I know the industry doesn’t allow for a dream like that. Even tradpub wants you to do the song and dance to sell. I wish I could opt out of the social part of being an author and let my books speak for me.

Edit: I guess I should clarify that I like interviews, talking about the craft, promoting fellow authors, etc. What I don’t like is being expected to mouth along to lyrics for 10 seconds and then insert the cover of my book with a bunch of tropes written on it.

Edit 2: I think I’m nailing down why I’m so uncomfortable. I don’t want people to think they know me in a parasocial way, and I’m really afraid of my looks being judged instead of my books. I wonder if male authors feel this pressure too, and if so, is it similar or different?

Edit 3: I get it. “This is how it is.” Yeah. I know. I think that’s bad.",RaeDMagdon,2025-10-08 22:31:14,1579,0.97,284,1863,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/writing/comments/1o1g89s/i_hate_that_writers_have_to_sell_themselves_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1o1g89s/i_hate_that_writers_have_to_sell_themselves_on/,self.writing,0,Discussion,Published Author,0,none,[],2242,63,,viral,,,,,,,,,,,,
1o3dbud,all,"[Bradbury] A brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct Friday in connection with a viral gameday fight at Ball Arena last year. Strahinja Jokic, 43, was sentenced to a year of probation on the misdemeanor and petty offenses","
A brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct Friday in connection with a viral gameday fight at Ball Arena last year.


Strahinja Jokic, 43, was sentenced to a year of probation on the misdemeanor and petty offenses, according to the Denver District Attorney’s Office.


Strahinja Jokic was originally charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, after a video went viral on social media that appeared to show him punching a man in the face courtside at Denver’s Ball Arena during an April 2024 game against the Los Angeles Lakers.


The Lakers fan who was punched, Nicholas Meyer, suffered a concussion, cuts and bruises on his face and a deviated septum, he claimed in a subsequent lawsuit.


Strahinja Jokic was charged in July 2024. He said then he felt he had done nothing wrong because he was defending an older man he had known for a very long time.


The gameday fight was not Strahinja Jokic’s first run-in with Denver law enforcement. In 2019, he was charged with assault and accused of choking and pushing a woman, then preventing her from calling 911.


In that case, Strahinja Jokic pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing phone service, as well as a felony count of trespassing, as part of a deferred sentence in which prosecutors agreed to eventually negate the trespassing conviction if he followed court rules for unsupervised probation and did not commit another crime for two years.


The trespassing charge was dismissed in 2022 after he successfully completed that term, court records show. The misdemeanor conviction stands. Charges of false imprisonment and assault against Strahinja Jokic were also dropped as part of the plea agreement in that 2019 case.

1nzejdb,all,How I made a horror game that accidentally sold 150k copies,"Hi! I’m Rone, the developer of *Emissary Zero*. This is my six-month post-release report.

Emissary Zero is a co-op horror (1-4 players). You are sent to explore a mysterious building at night. Find the Moon and try to return alive.

# Idea

The project was originally conceived as a linear horror game, but built with multiplayer in mind from the very beginning. Multiplayer had to work both online and in split-screen mode.

There’s no combat system - it’s a walking simulator with environmental interactions and puzzles. The main gameplay revolves around handling items: you can pick them up, carry, throw, and use them on other objects.

One of the early references was *Five Nights at Freddy’s*. I planned to borrow things like surveillance cameras, dynamic obstacles, and roaming monsters. But a few months later, those ideas were dropped and left in drafts. The only thing that remained from FNAF was a small easter egg in the title: if you shift FNAF one letter back in the alphabet, you get EMZE - the two-letter pairs from *Emissary Zero*. That’s how the game got its name.

# Technical Details

The game uses Unreal Engine 5, with 99% of the logic written in Blueprints. It uses Lumen for global illumination at high settings. There’s also a DirectX 11 version - it runs faster but uses simplified mobile-style graphics (Forward Shading) with limited lighting and post-processing effects. Decals were removed due to rendering issues, and some shaders had to be rewritten to work correctly under both DX11 and DX12.

From my previous game, I only reused the base of the dialogue system. Due to a tight schedule, I used quite a few environment assets from the marketplace.

For matchmaking, I used Steam Sessions, implemented via the Advanced Steam Sessions plugin. Later, with a patch, Steam Sockets were added. Voice chat was handled by a third-party plugin. The NVIDIA DLSS plugin was also used.

# Design Constraints

Because the game needed to support split-screen multiplayer, many full-world effects weren’t available - since there could be two active players in the same world. In many cases, effects had to be applied to each camera separately, for each local player - for example, through the UI.

Multiplayer (both online and local) had to work from start to finish without any artificial restrictions. That meant players could split up and explore different parts of the map at any time. Because of that, the game world ended up being semi-open - it has linear progression, but with shortcuts to previous areas that can be revisited at any point.

The game supports anywhere from 1 to 4 players (or even 8). The number of players could change mid-game (for example, if someone disconnects). So all puzzles and interactions were designed to be independent of player count (the only exception is the lever puzzle in the lab, where some levers are hidden automatically if fewer players are present).

# Demo

The Steam page went live at the end of August. After two months, it had about 50 wishlists. The first goal was to release a demo. Development was very tight, so the first version came out after just three months (end of October 2024). It wasn’t great at first.

Later, I expanded the basement section and added a new monster, which made the demo much better. In early December, a Brazilian streamer played it, and one of his TikToks hit 70K likes. That brought in the first wave of players who left feedback. The demo had strong retention - median playtime was 50 minutes (full completion took 30–60 minutes).

The demo was basically a light beta of the game’s opening, with nearly all core mechanics. Releasing and supporting the demo (similar to early access in some co-op games) helped tune the balance and overall game feel.

I added a Google Form for feedback, which stayed up until release. Thanks to it, I fixed nearly all bugs - big and small - that would’ve otherwise made it into the full version. I reduced overall difficulty, smoothed out frustrating sections, and improved UX so the demo could be played smoothly from start to finish without confusion about where to go next.

Shortly before release, the demo took part in Next Fest (March 2025) with 10K wishlists. By that time, it was polished enough to run without any technical issues. Next Fest brought 10K more wishlists, 800+ concurrent players, and the demo made it into the Top 25 most played during the event.

# Production Hell

The idea came up in June 2024. Before that, I was working on another game, but it was too big, so I shelved it (probably for good). Some elements from that project ended up in *Emissary Zero*.

From the start, I planned a short development cycle (less than a year). My first game took way too long, so I didn’t want to repeat that. Even if this one failed, at least it wouldn’t take forever.

At first, I had a small freelance job, but in September 2024, I quit to focus fully on the game. That meant I had a limited budget - savings that would last until spring 2025. So I set a target release date for March 2025, right after Next Fest, to gather more feedback and wishlists.

By January 2025, I locked the final release date - delays were no longer possible.

The last three months were intense crunch. Three weeks before release, Steam rejected the build due to copyright concerns with one of the characters. Communication with support and approving the build took a while, but thankfully, it was resolved - two days before release, Steam approved the build.

I managed to bring all story events together just two weeks before launch. Story texts were finished three days before release, and machine translation for other languages was done two days before. Even though a lot was done at the last moment, the release version was ready a day before launch. After a few playthroughs and small fixes (up to version 1.0.4), the game was released on March 28. At the time of release there were 35k wishlists.

About localization: most languages were machine-translated. Here’s how it worked - I wrote a script that scanned the localization file, took untranslated lines in small batches, sent them to an LLM to translate, then wrote them back into the file. It worked surprisingly well - I haven’t seen any Steam reviews complaining about translation quality.

# Marketing

There wasn’t any.  
I tried using Twitter, but it didn’t go well. Only one tweet got over 100 likes. Unlike my previous game, which had multiple viral gifs, *Emissary Zero* didn’t perform well on social media.

Before release, I sent a few keys to small streamers via Keymailer. All the big streamers and YouTubers found the game on their own.

# Launch

Post-launch was pretty calm. At first, Steam reviews were mixed - players complained about optimization and difficulty. These were fixed with patches within a week, and reviews later turned positive. Fun fact: Unreal Engine had a bug that caused random heavy stutters at high FPS. The fix was simply updating the project to a newer version of the engine.

Sales started off well and stayed stable. Then, in mid-April, sales jumped several times, and the game reached a new peak in players - I later found out a TikTok video had gone viral with 8 million views.

# Numbers Six Months Later:

* Median playtime: 3h 29m
* 1700+ reviews
* 195K wishlists
* 150K+ copies sold

# Updates & What’s Next

I gradually fixed bugs with patches. In July, I released a big update with new content and VR support.

Work on *Emissary Zero* is finished. I’m now working on a sequel, with new ideas I want to build on top of the systems from this game. I’d also love to bring it to consoles this time.

This game was a unique experience. It started as a small project, but ended up exceeding all expectations. For me, that’s a success.

1o1ykeq,all,My MIL thinks everyone is jealous of her because her tiktok went viral,"My MIL (40s F) recently posted a silly video on TikTok. That video wound up getting a ton of views. Last I saw, I believe it was around 8m. When the video first started doing well, she screenshotted her 1M views and was sending it, along with likes and comments screenshots into a group chat of all of her kids + the spouses and partners of kids. We all said “oh that’s cool” and laughed about some of the funny comments. 

The next morning, her video got enough traction that barstool messaged her and asked if they could repost it. Again, she sent a screenshot in the group chat. All fine and dandy, she’s excited and having fun. About an hour later, she called my husband and was talking to him about it. I guess for barstool to use your videos, you have to fill out a form or something. While they were talking, my husband asked if she had one of those creator rewards things set up where she could get paid from views. She said no because this was her only video with over 1M views. Then my husband had mentioned that she needed to read the entire form and make sure that they at least credit her because barstool does likely have creator rewards and would be getting paid for the views on her video. After that, he hung up because we were on our way out to get breakfast. Not even 2 minutes after hanging up, him mom texted and asked if my husband was jealous that her video went viral. He didn’t respond because he thought it was a ridiculous question. Then, she asked him if I was jealous - I post a bunch on a spam TikTok I have just for fun and because I enjoy editing videos and stuff. My husband responded and said “why would she be jealous” and his mother replied saying “well she posts so much trying to become a tiktoker, and I saw that she had a somewhat popular video yesterday so I don’t want her to feel like I’m outshining her”……. Honestly I just laughed because wtf else do I say??

A few hours later, husbands siblings called to chat and they both mentioned that their mom had asked the same to them, if they were jealous of her video and the attention it’s getting, despite one of them not liking attention or social media, and one posting a lot but on private accounts that only her friends can see. 

I told my husband that it simply sounds like she WANTS someone to be jealous for some weird reason, but I digress. This was just a weird side eye moment but I couldn’t not talk about it.

1o0bxv7,all,"SM is literally what everyone accuses Hybe of being. I genuinely believe this Hybe-hatred is just BTS resentment rebranded, prove me wrong?","

Ever since the MHJ/Nwjns thing reddit and kpop twitter have decided HYBE is the root of all evil. Chart manipulation, media play, mistreatment, obsession with other companies, controlling narratives, etc. But if you actually look at whats come out SM has literally been exposed for doing exactly the things people accuse HYBE of.

*Media manipulation:* SM literally hired a PR firm to create fake online narratives during their feud with HYBE. They made viral posts, spread anti HYBE talking points and had articles talking bad about HYBE groups, (not just the company) and tried to frame HYBE as ruining groups after takeovers. This is documented.

*Undermining other groups:* Nate from American Hustle Life said he was told not to work with BTS because they were just a “filler” group and to focus on EXO instead presumably by SMs side. That’s the level of arrogance they had even back then. This was 2014.

*Obsessed with other companies energy:* People love to say HYBE is obsessed with SM groups but SM literally created SuperM with the whole “the Avengers of Kpop” concept just to compete with BTS internationally and knock them down. Like they built an entire supergroup specifically to challenge BTS' success.
 
*Mistreatment of their idols:* I mean, do I really have to elaborate this one?

Also the whole 'stanning HYBE the company' thing but SM literally has a company fandom name: PinkBloods. They literally branded and marketed corporate stanning. Wheres the talk about that? Make it make sense.


Then theres this whole “every K-pop subreddit is run by HYBE stans” narrative.
If you want to see a real case of company stans running a subreddit go check out noir. That place is basically SMs PR department.
If you stan a HYBE or YG group dont even bother joining. youll be treated like youre working hand in hand with Netanyahu for liking BTS or Blackpink. Meanwhile SM groups get away with murder there. Thats an actual example of a subreddit run by corporate stans.

And people love to claim uncensored is full of HYBE stans but come on. Every negative and positive post about basically anything gets deleted there. if you look back at posts like Sugas scooter incident, or LSFs vocals controversy it wasnt “HYBE stans” driving those hate trains. It was, as usual, SM group fans front and center.

I was literally there when the reporting wars started. It began with Bunnies mass reporting every negative post about Min Hee Jin and NewJeans and every positive post about LSF or ILLIT. I watched the sub shift in real time. So yeah maybe its run by fans of *a* HYBE group now but ironically the ones who pretend they arent.



At the end of the day everything people accuse HYBE of, SM has actually done. Yet somehow HYBE gets treated like its uniquely evil and I genuinely dont think its because of HYBE itself.

The intensity of the hate just doesnt make sense otherwise. Its not normal for a company and their artists to get this much emotional reaction unless theres something deeper behind it. And if were being real that “something deeper” is probably BTS.

HYBE exists at this scale because BTS built it from nothing and for a lot of people thats still hard to swallow. It flipped the whole Kpop hierarchy that the Big 3 had defined for decades. Suddenly the “underdogs” became the standard. So now every frustration people used to feel about BTS, *the overexposure, the awards, the western success, the cultural shift etc.* gets projected onto HYBE and its other groups. Its easier to say “HYBE ruined Kpop” than to admit the landscape changed because BTS did what no one thought possible.

Thats why the rage feels so personal. Its not really about HYBEs business moves or even their artists. Its about what BTS represents. But I am open to having my mind changed if you feel there is a different reason.",thebarted,2025-10-07 16:50:09,709,0.73,282,991,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/1o0bxv7/sm_is_literally_what_everyone_accuses_hybe_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/1o0bxv7/sm_is_literally_what_everyone_accuses_hybe_of/,self.kpop_uncensored,0,THOUGHT,,0,none,[],3829,139,,viral,,,,,,,,,,,,

1o3jmdv,all,I’m Tired of Watching Trump De-Legitimize Everything That’s American,"I’m just gonna say it, I’m tired. Tired of watching this guy tear down everything that makes this country what it is. He doesn’t just attack people anymore, he attacks the idea of America. The elections. The law. The press. The truth. If it doesn’t serve him, he burns it down. And somehow, people cheer for it like that’s strength. I love this country. Always have. Even when things got messy, I believed the system worked because we believed in it. But Trump’s made a career out of convincing people that nothing’s real unless it serves him. That’s not leadership. That’s manipulation.

Remember when elections actually meant something? When losing didn’t automatically mean the whole thing was “rigged”? Now, every time he loses, it’s fraud. When he wins, it’s the will of the people. It’s exhausting. He’s taught millions to hate democracy, unless it hands them a trophy. That’s not America. That’s ego worship. And the courts aren’t the problem, he is. Every judge who rules against him? “Corrupt.” Every prosecutor doing their job? “Witch hunt.” Every jury? “Rigged.” No, man. It’s not the system. It’s you! He’s turned accountability into persecution, and now a huge chunk of the country actually believes law and order is just a political scam. That’s dangerous. That’s how democracy dies, not in a flash, but in a slow drip of doubt.

Also, the press isn’t the enemy. Yeah, the media messes up sometimes, everyone knows that. But Trump doesn’t want truth. He wants control. He’s turned “fake news” into “anything that doesn’t kiss his ass.” And somehow that stuck. Now half the country doesn’t believe facts even when they’re staring right at them. That’s not patriotism. That’s brainwashing. And since when did patriotism become a costume? He waves the flag like it’s a prop. Talks tough about “loving America” while trashing everyone who actually keeps it running, workers, soldiers, election workers, teachers, judges. He doesn’t love this country. He loves owning it. He loves the sound of his name more than the sound of the anthem.

I miss believing in America. I miss when we could argue and still believe in the same country. Now everything’s a conspiracy. Everyone’s the enemy. And for what? For one guy’s ego? Trump doesn’t build, he breaks. He doesn’t lift people up, he convinces them everything’s corrupt so he can stand on the rubble. I’m tired of watching that. I’m tired of pretending it’s normal. He hasn't madr America great again, he's made distrust the national religion. He’s spent years convincing people this country’s rigged against them, when the truth is, it only feels rigged because he’s been rigging their belief in it. I’m over it.

I love this country too much to keep watching him rot it from the inside. I want the America I grew up believing in flawed, loud, messy, but still ours. And I’m not letting him take that from me.",AggravatingClock7021,2025-10-11 07:34:03,6011,0.93,1292,7303,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/complaints/comments/1o3jmdv/im_tired_of_watching_trump_delegitimize/,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1o3jmdv/im_tired_of_watching_trump_delegitimize/,self.complaints,0,,,0,none,[],2867,68,,breaking news,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Reddit. I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”

I’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.

So… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

UPDATE: Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it'll take a bit for me to read all of this.

My sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I'm sorry I don't have more to tell yet, but I'll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ❤️

**Update 2 (Same Post): Another 4 hours later**

UPDATE2: Hey all. My sister’s husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we’re working out a solution if possible. He’s been really understanding as have all of you.

Also, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ’office.’ It’s weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ’office.’

Thanks for all the support. And the award. I really don't have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ❤️‍🩹

*OOP responds to one of the top* [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/comment/mml4rza/?context=3):

>**OOP:** I really appreciate your comment, I feel as if you nailed exactly how I’ve been feeling but couldn’t articulate in the moment.  
It’s comforting to know I’m not totally off-base here. I will need to see what I’m willing to do with this situation, I don’t want to lose my family, but I don’t want to start begging to be heard either.  
Thank you. ❤️

*Going no contact:*

>Yeah, I’m not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.  
It’s definitely something I’ll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.  
I just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won’t hesitate to step back. I don't think I want to know my family if they can’t appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.  
Thanks for the insight. ❤️

Commenter (downvoted): Questions -

1. does your office door lock, if so why wasn't it locked?
2. how was this unattended 3 year old able to get his hands on crackers & apple juice in an apartment that he is presumably not familiar with? Why were these items so easy for him to get to?
3. if you knew in advance that he & your sister were coming, why wouldn't you make *any* effort to either secure delicate/important items or move them somewhere he can't reach?

>**OOP:** 1. The “office” is a converted clothes closet. The apartment’s from the 40s and has a weird layout. There’s no lock on the door, the door is just a heavy old one. Tbh I’ve been wondering if my sister might have opened it for him. I just don't get why??? 2. The crackers and juice weren’t mine, sister brought them. I had no idea he had access to them during the night until after the fact. 3. I didn’t get much notice. I saw her message around 10AM Saturday, and they arrived around 2PM. My place was a mess, so I spent most of that time cleaning before they came by. In hindsight, yeah, I should’ve been more cautious with my setup, but it didn’t even cross my mind that anything like this would happen as I thought the office area was inaccessible to him. What he did pull off of the shelves was moved higher up and out of reach and in an area where he could be kept an eye on.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)**: April 16, 2025 (5 days later)**

Hey again.

Just wanted to post a quick update since it’s been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here’s where we're at.

Last Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn’t do it. The door was too heavy for him.

You probably can guess where this is going. :=)

BIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he’d be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.

On Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn’t unblocked me, and from what I’ve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.

I also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don’t fully get it, but they’ve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don't think either of those three still care, really, and I'm fine if they see this. Do better.

Anyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it’s mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he’ll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.

When I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she’s lying. He also said he’s not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn’t quite add up to a toddler acting alone.

Apparently, she’s been telling him I have a “gambling addiction” (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will “wake me up,” which is… new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.

So yeah. That’s where we’re at:

* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.
* Sister still has me blocked and won’t talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.
* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.

Thanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.

One thing I’ve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister *did* do something to my setup on purpose?

I don’t want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the ""he's just curious"" comments like she didn’t take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she’s been saying I have a “crippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction” and needed to “grow up”????

It’s just… weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don’t know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or “teach me a lesson”… that’s messed up. You're not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could’ve done all of that alone. It's sick if she blamed her own son for it.

So yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.

And if you're my sister reading this… Which I'm guessing you are, because I bet you'd love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))

I don’t know why you blocked me. I don’t know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.

And if Max really did all of it on his own… I hope you’re paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That's all.

Thanks for reading, those who did.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wait - I thought the whole family was blowing up your phone telling you how mean you were?

>**OOP:** Yes a week ago, before my first post. Is there something I can clarify for you here? My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ”screamed at her child” over a ”minor mistake.” I do see the people going ”haha blowing up her phone” and I do not understand what is wrong with the wording?

Commenter: I think chatgpt is being used a lot on Reddit lately, especially in AITA type subs and a common indicator that it’s a fake post is that AI always uses the “blowing up my phone” phrase so that’s probably why they’re questioning it

>**OOP:** Ohh… I see. 🤣 Thank you for clarifying! Beep, boop.

Commenter: I’m really glad things are turning for the better. But what about the other damages (Gaming chair, keyboard, etc)?

>**OOP:** My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I’ve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)  
Keyboard… ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard’s ones (both mechanical) so it’s a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.  
The cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ”cracked” was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one… but yeah. 3:

Commenter: Um, why aren't you just having your bil pay for a new keyboard and monitor? Or professional cleaning for the chair? That's all part of the repairs.

>**OOP:** We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well… 👨‍⚖️📝🔒  
The computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.

*The 'addiction':*

>I'll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ’worst’ of it. (And it was so worth it)  
I don't play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I've spent under $600.  
I get it, even that might look crazy to people who don't play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction…? Bruh.  
She should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she's gotta be concerned over something. 🤣🤣🤣

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kds0zk/my_25f_sister_30f_is_spiraling_but_i_dont_know/) **2: May 3, 2025 (over 2 weeks later, 3 from OG post)**

**Title:** My \[25F\] sister \[30F\] is spiraling but I don’t know how or if I should help.

A few weeks ago, I made a post (not here) about how my sister’s toddler \[3M\] almost destroyed my PC setup. Long story short, she and her son were staying with me for one night, he got into my office, and the whole setup got wrecked with juice and cracker bits shoved into the tower. The situation was awful, and when I asked my sister for help covering the damage, she made an excuse and blamed me instead.

It became whole family drama. My sister blocked me and acted like the whole thing was my fault, but her husband (my BIL) reached out on his own. He checked the damage himself, helped take the PC in for repairs, and ended up covering the costs because he was genuinely embarrassed by the way she acted. He even started questioning whether their toddler could have done that much damage on his own, especially after the kid couldn’t even open the door by himself. My BIL thought maybe my sister left it open or did something herself.

Within a week of that, my BIL confronted her and well, she kicked him out of the house. Like, full-on, told him to get the hell out, packed up his things, dumped them and left them by the curb like he was a stray dog. He told me she screamed that he was “betraying her” and “taking the side of that fucking Reddit bitch,” meaning me. She also apparently accused him of conspiring and cheating on her with me to “humiliate her publicly,” which… What???

She hasn’t let him see their kid since. No visits. No phone calls. She’s gone full black hole mode and is completely unreachable, threatening cops if he goes near. She’s blocked me, my brother, even some extended family, and is only talking to our parents, who are still enabling her but I think its only so they can keep Max at arm’s lenght.

Meanwhile, I’m hearing rumors she’s been telling people I’m unhinged, psychotic, and that I made the whole thing up. She told one of our cousins that I “lured” her kid into the office like some kind of trap or setup.

I don’t know if this is postpartum-related, or if something snapped, or if she’s just always been this vindictive and I didn’t want to see it. But I’m scared. Scared for her kid. Scared for her husband. And yeah I’m also scared for myself, because if she’s willing to ruin her whole marriage and turn the family against me just to protect a lie…?

My parents want to keep it under wraps, but I know my BIL wants to get her help. I want to get her help too, but I don’t know where to start or what to do.

What can I start with to possibly push her towards someone who can help her out? Has someone here dealt with a situation like this before? I feel helpless, as I know she is an adult and has free-will but I fear for her safety and my nephew’s safety as well…

My BIL voiced wanting to divorce her and told my parents he will get his son whether they approve or not. His side of the family is furious with mine and I’ve no idea where I stand because yeah, I guess I started this.

Is this salvageable? If so, how? What can I do? Who can I contact within the states…? Is there anything I can do even? Does anyone know?

***Top Comments:***

**LhasaApsoSmile:** I think your parents need to talk to her because this is crazy. The kid did what 3 yo's do but she failed as a mother by not minding him. Your BIL stepped up to fix it. But her reaction is nuts. There has to be more here. I think your parents are in a better place to figure out what is going on.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Jelly-6298/comments/1lk9axs/a_brief_underwhelming_update_aio/) **3: June 25, 2025 (over 1.5 months from previous post, 2.5 from OG)**

Hello everyone,

It’s been a while, so I didn’t want to post this on AIO, but for those still interested in my situation, here’s an update. :)

The good news first:

* My PC is fully functional again. The store was able to recover it!
* My nephew is now in a safe and stable environment with my brother-in-law.

Unfortunately, there have also been some difficult developments:

* My brother-in-law is currently in the process of separating from my sister.
* It seems I’ve essentially been disowned by my mother, and now, it appears, by my father as well. The only one still in contact with me is my brother.

Thank you to those who have checked in or supported me during all this. It truly means a lot.

***OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Good to hear things are fixed with th pc now, but that's awful that you've been disowned by your parents. Why did they do that? Unless I'm remembering wrong, they were only in contact with her to have access to their grandkid.

Sounds like you're in the middle of a lot right not so I won't push, but I wish you luck. Just know that people are on your side and are praying for you 🙏

>**OOP:** Thank you! I am very happy to hear that.  
My parents have unfortunately been swayed by my sister's lies. I guess I can say that she is of the mind that BIL was cheating on her with me and that we want to ""steal her son."" I am still trying to cope with what has happened (poorly, but work and studies keep me busy thankfully...) and to clear the air.  
There is a lot happening as you guessed, but I'll give out more updates after everything settles down. Right now I'm just taking it one day at a time.

Commenter: I'm glad your nephew is safe! Try to keep that connection - he'll appreciate it in the future.

I wish you the best of luck with the rest of the family. It's not your fault & you need to work to accept that. Maybe find a therapist to talk this thru with? You need to protect your mental health. I'm also a younger sister & I took on way too much of trying to fix things when I was your age.

>**OOP:** Thank you for the advice! Therapy hadn't even crossed my mind... I'll look into it for sure!

# New Update

**\*\*\*\*\*Final Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nw3wjd/final_update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my/)**: October 2, 2025 (3.5 months later, 6 from OG post)\*\*\*\*\***

Hey everyone. This is the final update to my posts on [r/AmIOverreacting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/) :

* [AIO for threatening to take my sister to court after her toddler destroyed my $2,000 gaming setup because she said I should’ve “baby-proofed my apartment”?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to_court/)

It’s been a long while since I last posted, and honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted to give another update at all. A lot has happened over the past six months, some of it good, some of it really heavy, and some of it that I’m still struggling to process. But I know a lot of you followed the whole thing from the beginning and my direct messages have been full of so many awesome, supportive people, I feel as if I owe all of you a final update before letting this matter go.

First, the positives: My PC is alive and well and has been for a while. The shop did a miracle job restoring it and it’s running beautifully again. It almost feels symbolic now, like after everything blew up in my life, at least this one thing that mattered to me is still standing. xd

I’ve also gotten closer to my brother-in-law (well, ex-BIL now, I guess, though it feels weird to call him that since he’s still family to me). He has full custody of my nephew, and that little kid is thriving. He’s calmer, happier, and honestly just a joy to be around in ways I didn’t even realize before. And he turned four *after* all the court stuff ended, so we could have his birthday in peace!!! :)

My BIL has his own family helping him, and I’ve been pitching in too whenever I can. It’s exhausting at times, but I don’t regret a second of it. My nephew deserves stability, and my BIL deserves support after everything he’s had to go through. Watching him step up as a single dad has been inspiring.

Now for the complicated part: my family.

When things first went down, my parents were still on my sister’s side, and I was basically the black sheep. But something happened during the legal proceedings that made them realize she wasn’t well and that I hadn’t been exaggerating about any of it. For the first time in what feels like forever, they stopped defending her blindly. They actually reached out to me, apologized, and admitted they’d been wrong... well, kind of. But I couldn't be asked to escalate it again. It’s been slow, but they’ve been trying to rebuild things with me. Part of me resents that it took them *this much* to finally see the truth, but I’m also relieved not to be completely estranged from my parents anymore. I'm still trying to decide what kind of a relationship they deserve to have with me after all of this.

As for my sister…

I don’t even know how to start. During the custody battle, she completely broke down. A lot of stuff came out, including the fact that she had broken and damaged other people’s things in the past (friends, her coworker's stuff), intentionally. She admitted she did it because, in her words, BIL “owed her more” as the mother of their child, and destroying things was her way of “making him notice her.”

She also said something else that stuck with me: that when she broke things, she felt powerful. She said people underestimated her, ignored her, treated her like she was just “a mom.” But when she destroyed something, she knew she couldn’t be ignored. It forced people to react, and it sure did. I know some of the people witnessing this in real time still pity her, which... I don't know how to feel about it.

Still, it explains so much of her behavior, not just with the PC, but with her marriage, with our family and how she’s spiraled. She wanted to feel like she mattered, but instead of asking for help in a healthy way or seeking support, she turned to control and destruction. And when that wasn’t enough, she escalated.

Writing that out makes me feel so sad, honestly. It’s like everything I suspected about the PC wasn’t just a suspicion. And to think all of this could have been avoided if she sought help or accepted going to couple's therapy properly. Apparently my BIL had suggested it a few times to her, but she declined.

After she lost custody of my nephew, things spiraled fast. She had a complete breakdown, and long story short, she’s now in jail awaiting transfer to a psychiatric facility. I don’t want to go into every detail, but it’s safe to say it’ll be a long time before I see her again. Or want to see her again.

And here’s the part I can’t quite make peace with: I feel bad for her.

I know that might sound crazy after everything she put me through, after how she tore our family apart, and after what she did to her own son. But she’s still my sister. There’s this ache I can’t quite get rid of, because I don’t know if the person she is now is who she always was, or if something in her just snapped along the way. I look back on our childhood and teenage years and wonder if there were signs that I missed, if there was some pattern of behavior I brushed off as moodiness or sibling rivalry that was actually something worse.

What complicates those feelings even more is everything that happened after my posts started spreading. I never expected them to blow up the way they did. I just wanted an outside perspective because my whole family was gaslighting me, making me feel insane for protecting my own belongings. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. On Twitter, YouTube, Tiktok, even some news article was made about it. Someone tagged me to let me know that Smosh had even featured my story, which was surreal and honestly sort of humiliating in its own way. (Even though being noticed was kind of cool, I guess?)

Strangers were debating my family like it was some kind of reality TV show, and I had no control over it. At first, I was grateful for the validation, but over time, it started to eat away at my conscience. Keeping my posts public turned out to be a mistake.

I know hindsight is 20/20, but I regret not locking them down sooner. By the time BIL’s lawyer told us it would be best to hide everything, the damage had already been done. My sister had already seen the comments and the full force of the internet turned against her. And she hyperfixated on it.

That is not just me speculating either, one of our cousins told me she would rant constantly about it during the legal proceedings, always bringing it back to the posts and how I had “publicly humiliated her.” Apparently, she would spend hours scrolling, trying to dig up my posts, looking for new comments, even after I hid them. It was like pouring salt in a wound, and she couldn’t stop picking at it.

I keep asking myself if I made things worse by letting it all stay up as long as it did. If I gave her more ammunition for her paranoia orr if I pushed her further toward the breakdown that ended with her losing everything. Part of me feels like I failed her, like maybe if I had been more careful, she wouldn’t have spiraled so badly. But then another part of me reminds myself that it wasn’t the internet that broke her, it was something already inside her. The posts didn’t cause her to smash my PC, or to lash out at BIL, or to neglect her own child. Those were choices she made long before Reddit ever came into the picture.

I realize there’s no point in deleting them. Even if I scrubbed my entire account clean, the internet never forgets. Copies are out there somewhere, archived and dissected on forums I’ll never even see. I can’t control that, no matter how much I might want to. What I can control is how I move forward, how I take care of myself, my nephew, and the family I still have.

The truth is, moving forward has been a mixed bag. On one hand, my daily life feels lighter without the constant chaos of my sister’s presence. I’m not coming home to find something broken, I’m not waking up to accusatory texts, and I’m not walking on eggshells waiting for the next outburst. That alone has been a kind of freedom I didn’t realize how badly I needed. On the other hand, there’s this strange emptiness where she used to be. Even if her presence was destructive, she was still there, part of the fabric of my family, and now there’s just this jagged hole.

My nephew asks about her sometimes. He doesn’t fully understand what happened, of course. He just knows “mommy is sick” and can’t take care of him right now. BIL and I try to keep our answers simple, but the truth is, I don’t know what kind of relationship, if any, he’ll be able to have with her in the future. I think about that a lot, because no matter how much I’ve been hurt by her, I can’t help but imagine what it’ll feel like for him one day when he’s old enough to learn the truth. How do you explain to a child that their mother did what my sister has done? How can it ever make sense to him? I don't know what to do when the day comes that either BIL or I have to explain what happened.

As for me, I’ve been in therapy since all of this started (recommended by some of the lovely people in the comments and in my direct messages, thank you.) At first, it was just a way to vent, but it’s become essential, to be honest. My therapist keeps reminding me that none of this is my fault and that my sister’s choices were her own, that I didn’t “ruin her life” by posting about the PC, and that it’s not my job to fix her. I hope to one day believe everything that my therapist is telling me.

As for my sister, I don’t know what the future holds for her, or if she’ll ever get better.

But if anyone else has problems like this, maybe be a bit more careful than I was. I spent the last months worrying I'd get charged with something for causing emotional turmoil over a Reddit post.

On a positive note, the stress caused me to get reconnected with an old hobby, retro electronics! Did you know the 3DS is considered retro now? I didn't! I feel old! I'm the same age as Pokemon Crystal!!!

Anyways, from now on I will be focusing on graduating and working to help my BIL pay off the debt that accumulated during the legal proceedings/investigation. But now that it's over, it's nice to know that at least for the coming months, things should be peaceful for me and those who matter the most to me. :)

Thank you to everyone who followed this from the beginning. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: The only thing I can tell you is that you're not wrong for feeling bad for your sister. **This is not advice that you should forgive her**, to be clear. But she was (and is, debatably!) an important part of your life, feeling bad for her is normal empathy for your loved ones. I hope she finds a way to process her mental issues and is able to authentically and meaningfully make amends to you and your family.

Regarding posting everything online: I mean, yeah, with the benefit of hindsight, it probably would have been better to delete the posts as soon as you got the insight you needed, but that seal is already long-since broken. Deleting at this point is no good, given how many times it's been reposted/commentated on.

>**OOP:** Thank you, you really hit the nail on the head. I’m not ready to forgive, but I can still feel for her. It’s a weird, heavy mix of emotions. I appreciate your thoughtful words and hope for healing, however long it takes. :)

Commenter: What an update ! \[...\] And did you ever find out if your nephew actually touched your PC, or it was all done by your sister (the crackers, apple juice...) ?

>**OOP:** Yes, I guess Reddit really does love a ""saga"" like this. And yes, all the crackers and juice were 100% my sister. -\_- ...Thank you for your kind words!

Commenter: \[...\] Also, don’t feel bad about blogging about this. It may have added fuel to your sister’s struggle…but if you hadn’t either (a) she would have found something else to be paranoid about/obsess over (as is common in mental health issues) or (b) may have been able to continue sweeping her issues under the rug and never gotten the help she needs.

>**OOP:** That’s a really thoughtful perspective. You’re right, if it hadn’t been the posts, it might’ve been something else. I appreciate the reassurance and your kindness. Thank you!

*Therapy for nephew and forgive yourself:*

>I agree, therapy has already helped me a lot, and I’m looking into it for my nephew too. (I believe my BIL may have been recommended something after the court case for custody ended?) Thank you for the reminder to forgive myself, that part is a work in progress. I’ll try to update down the road if things shift more, maybe in a few years at least. I'm a bit over the internet right now. xd

Commenter: \[...\]Side Note: Out of curiosity -- what is the PC that you got and the monitors? (Asking as a person who is looking for a gaming PC)

>**OOP:** There’s something really comforting in what you shared, thank you. Sibling dynamics can be a *lot.*  
My PC is a custom build, but here are the parts its made of. (It may be long x\_@)  
Case: be quiet! Pure Base 500DX  
Case Fans: ARCTIC P12 PWM PST A-RGB 0dB  
RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 32GB (2 x 16GB)  
Storage: Kingston 2TB NV2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD  
Power Supply: Asus TUF Gaming 850W  
Motherboard: Asus PRIME Z790-P WIFI  
CPU Cooler: ARCTIC Freezer 36 A-RGB  
Graphics Card: Asus GeForce RTX 4060 Ti ProArt OC Edition 8GB GDDR6  
Processor: Intel Core i7-13700K – LGA1700, 16-core (8P+8E), 3.4GHz Base Clock, 30MB  
Note for this one (the processor) \^\^ I don't recommend getting 13th-14th gen Intel processors, there's a running BIOS issue that was discovered last year and the one I have needed to be fixed. (The store let me know of it while my computer was being fixed and they updated my BIOS for me.) <\_< Honestly I don't recommend Intel Processors in general.  
Also, my computer is 1,5 years old (it runs very nicely right now, but still) and I am not a professional. But it has not blown up! And I think that's pretty good. :3  
Thanks again for the kind words!

Commenter: What did you sister do to end up in jail?

>**OOP:** I’m not comfortable sharing specifics about that online, but I can say it was very serious. I understand if people doubt me, but my priority is keeping my family’s privacy protected. Thank you for understanding.

**Editor's note:** I did message OOP a couple of months ago (after the BORU's had been up for awhile) to see if she wanted me to take the original BORU's down, but didn't receive a response.

**Thanks to u/soayherder & u/queenlegolas for suggesting this BoRU**

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IUYgAXHcMs): **September 15, 2025**

So my wife was recently offered a job across the country, which requires relocation but also will have frequent travel obligations. My wife feels this would be a huge plus to her career but issue is we have two children and my practice is here.

What she will earn is not even half of what I currently make. She is currently not working so I told her if she wants to take the job she would have to help with childcare expenses which would likely include a nanny cause I sometimes work nutty hours depending if I have a mandated hospital shift. She feels this is unfair because she would have to cover her own living expenses and paying for childcare on top of that would leave her with very little.

This job is not even providing a relocation bonus. She suggested we move but everything we know is here. Our children have their friends here and transferring my medical license is not all that simple. Her final suggestion is she takes the kids, I stay here and cover the cost of childcare and expenses cause she claims child care and CoL *(editor's note: cost of living)* is cheaper. Just not cheap enough for her potential salary to sustain me being a SAHP.

I want to support her but her suggestions seem half baked to me.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs along with few others**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. I would understand if you were a stay at home dad, that would be reasonable. I didn’t really get, are you completely against of her going to work, or this one specifically? If this one then you are completely justified, especially considering that there are kids involved. Ripping them away from their friends is rude and unnecessary

> **OOP:** I am not against her working at all, just not in favor of moving to a different state.

**What are the long term prospects staying locally for OOP's wife?**

> **OOP:** In what she wants to do not great. She can leverage her engineering degree to work at a civil engineering firm doing consulting but she did that prior and she hated it. Her current offer actually would have her working on infrastructure and work on something with meaning.

+

> She is a female engineer and sick of working in consulting, she wants to do something that matters but it is a big boys club here. Which is a factor as to why she became a SAHM.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. This seems like a really strange situation for a married couple with children to be in. On the face of it, your wife thinking her taking this job is a viable option is crazy. It clearly doesn’t make sense in all of the ways that matter (logistically, financially, emotionally). The fact she suggested she take the kids and you stay is very, very strange. So it makes me wonder what else is going on? Are you happily married? Has she been a SAHM for a while? Maybe she’s worried about not being able to get back into the workforce, and thinks she has to take any opportunity she gets? Have you sat down as a couple to discuss her getting a job and what that will look like for your family, what’s important etc? Are you willing for your career to take the backseat for a while so she can reestablish herself in her career? Etc etc. lack of communication seems to be the issue here, but also maybe deeper rooted problems in your marriage?
> 
> **Downvoted Commenter:** As as medical Dr he could get a new job easily. He doesn't say this. There is more than one side here.
>> 
>> **OOP:** It actually is not that simple to just go practice in a completely different state. Where we would move to is not part of IMLC *(editor's note: Interstate Medical Licensure Compact)*. Also I cannot just up and leave my patients like that also.

**Commenter 3:** What is it about this specific job that has her willing to leave you on the other side of the country while she and the kids start a new life? Does she know somebody at this job? Or have connections in the area that you know of? Seems fishy to me.

> **OOP:** From what she has told me she was tapped for this position by her old professor and mentor from college.

**OOP on if he has his own practice or works for someone else**

> **OOP:** I have my own practice and also work and teach at our state learning hospital. Director - Multiple Sclerosis Center, and Director - Neurology Residency Program.

+

> I specialize in MS. I am sure many would understand but many of them would be disappointed and it would take time for me to find someone that is willing to do this especially at the rates I take. Not many here take Medicaid.

**How old are OOP's children?**

> **OOP:** 5 and 8

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/gxi5FuFoXJ): **September 18, 2025 (three days later)**

Update to AITAH for calling my wife selfish for even considering taking a job across the country and trying to uproot our family.

Brief update since I got some requests, not much has changed. I spoke with our kids and of course they like it where we are they are kids. The reason my wife wants to take this job is because she feels due to nature of how she got the offer her old professor / mentor and that she is also a female engineer she understands her position.

My wife is free to do what she pleases she does not need my permission but by no means can she expect us to uproot everything on the drop of a dime. I would never ask that for you.

I did suggest she tries and create her own firm here and find like minded individuals who share a similar experience and create the work environment she wants. She is concerned she won't be able to break through that barrier of entry. I told we could find a means to fund said venture, but logistics of moving does not make sense at this. I would need at minimum a year to get my affairs in order.

Working on research, working on opening an infusion center near the hospital that would take every insurance. This is a big one for me since many of the infusion centers near us do not take certain insurances since they pay so little. Looking to possibly expand my MS clinic with more providers who are willing do this labor of love for our community. I cannot just drop all of that.

I did tell my wife I have no intention of stopping her, and if she wishes to go that is fine but I would not be sustaining two households. She moves she would be responsible for all costs associated with the move. I will cover our shared expenses and primary residence and that is all. I will cover everything here and she would be responsible for her own expenses. I told her I would probably also lower or get of the credit cards also since I know her she would live off credit if she had to.

I threw out the option if she can request she works from home three out of the four weeks she is not traveling and we can take it slow. See what the housing market is like, see what schools look like, normal stuff you do before moving. She was not in favor of waiting since allegedly they need her answer by October.

I have no desire to divorce but I am a child of divorce and was raised by my dad. Overall his outlook on divorce has always been no point fighting if the person has already checked out. If my wife wants out I will respect that.

My wife has only been a SAHP for around 5 years. She worked when we had our first born and well into the pregnancy of our second. She took maternity leave when that was done went back to work. Few months after her return she was passed for a project / contract she did the legwork to secure which lead her to quit and stay home with the kids. Our kids have been in daycare, under grandparents care. My mom took two years to help with our first born her parents took off time for our second. Our second has been in ""academic daycare"" as she puts since they were 3. So it is not like she does not get breaks or is always with the children alone.

My hours can be chaotic but I made her well aware of this when we started to date and progress. When we started to date I was already vested in our community. My gut tells me she is going to take the job, and yes it possibly will lead to divorce and if that is the case given how much traveling she will be doing I suspect I would be granted primary custody. I would not take CS from her have no desire or need for it.

Sorry for the stream of consequences, it is slightly disjointed cause this is an frustrating position to be in. I have no desire to be in this position but I have other responsibilities I cannot just drop without proper notice. If it comes to divorce that is the way it played out and you just roll with it. As my parents told me I will tell my kids. Just because they were no longer together does not mean either of them loved me any less.

Granted it was not a cross country thing in our case, my parents lived blocks away from one another. Was a pretty easy transition on my part, I hope we can do the same for our kids if need be. The deal is far worse than I thought but it is a small start up thing with a small team. Who won the project since they took a huge cut on their profits. So pay is actually a lot less than half what I make. More like one third of what I make if that.

So I can see how she cannot afford to cover any shared expenses, she probably will barely be able to cover her own expenses. We will see, but all signs point to her taking the job and we will jusy adjust but if divorce happens it happens that is life. I do love my wife but she is her own person with free will. 

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** So she wants to move across the country to take a job that wouldn't even sustain her alone?

> **OOP:** She barely will be able to sustain herself, allegedly just a temporary thing until they establish themselves as a firm / company first.

**Commenter 2:** If she takes the job just be careful . See a lawyer about protecting assets in case of divorce , cause my guess is she is by herself , across the country , no kids . It’s like the old saying “ when the cats away the mice will play”
>  
> **OOP:** If it comes to that I would not fight it, I will give her half of what she is entitled to. Probably would also just buy her out of the house also. Not going to sweat the little things. She clearly does not like it here. She wants more that is fine.
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** I was thinking more about your business and retirement . I hope I’m wrong but also was thinking of doing it behind your back not asking for divorce
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** That is a good point. Was not thinking about that.

**OOP responds to a downvoted comment on what his wife gave up when he was in medical school? What has she done to help contribute to the household?**

> **OOP:** We were friends when I was in Medical school, were not dating. She did not quit her job until our second child was born, and even that was after a year or so. Leaving my obligations on such short notice is not possible and far from professional. For us to move I would at minimum need a year. Our kids have been in daycare since they were three and we had grandparent support for each child. She is not isolated or anything. Yes, I understand she wants a professional career but this job by all metrics is a bad deal.

**Commenter 3:** What are your hours now and what will they be after you expand your clinic? You said your hours were already chaotic so I’m just curious.

> **OOP:** Outside of of my mandated hospital shifts, I am home no later than seven. So around 7 to 7. Once tbey go to sleep I may respond to patient messages, review and update notes from 12 to 2 once a week.
> 
> Sometimes I do work weekends since some my patients are working parents so that is only time they can come in but that is like 8 to 11 am. Only have a handful of weekend patients, that is a once a month thing.
> 
> Edit: I know it is less than ideal but I have my reasons for going this far, my grandfather had MS and it was rough for him.

**Commenter 4:** I would reconsider child support when the time comes. Your children are young, if you take the child support and do something towards their future, investments or such, it could dramatically change their lives. Regardless of how much you earn, save, etc., with young children it seems like there will be many challenges that we didn't have to face and a bit extra may make an enormous difference in their lives and future.

> **OOP:** May be ego or pride but if we divorce over this I will not request CS and let her use that money how she sees fit. Hopefully she would do what is best for our kids. I don't want to take money from her if we separate when she claimed she could not afford it.
> 
> I would want to limit my interactions with her as much as I can, if she does not pay I don't want to have to chase her, request hearings if she does not pay, or deal with her possible adjustments.
> 
> Thankfully, I have been savings for our kids from day one. I will consult my attorney if it does come to it though.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ZYKbgFuHg9): **September 29, 2025 (11 days later)**

This will be my last update, and it was a hard one to make. I appreciate the feedback and suggestions especially the one mentioning the looking at adjacent states. While some will say my priorities are skewed, our children don't want to move and I have close ties to the community. I do feel I have a responsibility to my patients and students. I know for some such commitments seem fleeting but for those with MS it takes a long time to find a doctor they are comfortable with, and that is important especially with such an unpredictable condition. I run local support groups, hold information seminars, take part in trials for new treatments. Currently about to start our own stemcell therapy trial for those with more active and progressive progression that has been resistant to other therapies. Main goal is to get information, but also provide individuals a means to get access to this treatment that already shows promise but it is expensive.

All of that would be moot if our kids did not want to say, and I get it for some kids don't have a say but they are an active part of our family and their opinion does matter.

Now for the claims I am uncaring, I do care and love my wife but I also feel a relationship is not something you fight for. Either it works or it does not, fighting to prove how deep you care or love someone is weird. Who am I to try and sway or change someone's mind. She wants to go that is her prerogative. So long story short she did take the job.

As for divorce, she does not want divorce but I am on the fence. Spoke with my parents and in laws and they do agree what she is doing makes zero sense but my wife can be stubborn so as my FIL put it, once she made up her mind nothing will change it. Your only options are go with it and be a safety net for if she fails, and he does agree statistically she will fail.

I don't want to be some fallback plan for if stuff goes south. Her plan for the kids is for them to stay with me and she comes over for major holiday's and two weeks in the summer. Based off expenses she will need some additional support rent will be around $1750 not counting utilities and stuff. Her projected take home will be around $3.5k.

So more she talks to about this plan worse it seems. So to help I offered to cover six months rent, but most likely this will lead to our separation at the very least. She is slightly upset that I am willing to hire a nanny now that she is leaving, but I explained hiring a nanny when she was not working and our kids have been in ""academic"" daycare as she likes to put. Why exactly would we need a nanny? I reminder her she willfully left her job and I did support that choice cause that is what she wanted to do.

Either way still have not broken the news to the kids, they do know she was thinking of taking a job and may be far away for a time.

I spoke with an attorney and I am going to hold off on it cause everything the kids know is here and they have a established route and support system. So they highly doubt she will try to take them, so overall going to try this LDR thing but idk. A part of me does feel like she is just using me cause I highly doubt she would make this move if she did not have some level of support, even her father said as much.

End of the day maybe she wants me to fight for our marriage but way I see it is a marriage worth keeping if you need to fight for it. I love her and do not want her to go but if she feels she must then she must. I am not going to sit here and pretend her happiness is dependent on me or our kids. She is a beautiful person and would be egotistical of me to think she will not find another person who is more in step with her desires.

I think we will be fine no matter what happens, I am prepared to buy her out of the house at market value, will split what needs to be split and call it a day. We will co-parent the best we call. I do not hate her or anything. She currently does not like her current life and that is fine. Maybe I am just a weird guy but I don't see any point in therapy because the fact she wants to do this means this means that much to her and facts are facts if she was thinking of the kids or our marriage she would not even consider this as a viable option, let alone take the offer.

If divorce ends up happening spoke with my lawyer and he told me it would be up to me to request it, it is not automatically awarded during the custody portion. I most likely will not request it and hope she does what is best for our children when it comes to saving for higher education or future expenses like a house or w/e.

Thanks again the feedback, our family will be fine.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Move for her, because he loves her and wants to see her career succeed? Do you know how easy it is for a male doctor who's halfway decent to get a job offer? and how hard it is for a female engineer who's had 5 empty years on her resume to get a job offer in the middle of a recession?

When the world is fair and women don't have to speak twice as loud or work treble as hard to be given a fraction of the same recognition, then you can judge her for wanting to take the job.

> **OOP:** Our kids don't want to move though. Would you be cool if your parents took from what you knew friends and family to be away from all of that?

**Commenter 2:** I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more rational and level headed person. Maybe that’s the physician in him? Wish you well Doc! She’s having a midlife crisis and you shouldn’t cater to it. Good luck mate

> **Commenter 3:** Eh, a fully rational person wouldn't pay his wife to abandon him and his kids against his will.
>> 
>> **OOP:** I am doing so cause I want to provide best possible route for our kids to have a relationship with their mother. I am not a monster, she is the mother of my children. I don't want her to be struggling to the point that even if she wants to see our children she cannot.
>> 
>> We are probably done, but I don't want to force that on our kids. If they want nothing to do her that will he for them to choose, but I will limit any excuse she could use that I was the reason things turned out this way.
>> 
>> I will just treat it like any other bill. Don't get me wrong I am fully prepared to divorce, and if she wants to turn this into some spectacle I am also down to go down that rabbit hole, and trust me my attorney is more than willing to take my money to do so. LOL

**Would OOP be on the hook for all of the debt that his wife will accumulate if the divorce happens?**

> **OOP:** My lawyer explained while married debt is shared an argument can be made that debt she accumulated in a different state can be taken out of the calculations but I will keep track on that. Part of the reason why my lawyer told me to leave her on my credit so I can motor what is spent and when it gets to a certain threshold I can pull the trigger on the papers.

**Commenter 4:** Understand your reasoning.... but please stick to your 6-month plan. I fear you are being used. Kudos for including your kids in the conversation... that's huge. Shows you are a caring dad.

Honestly, it seems wife wants to bolt... but wants you to be the bad guy on this. DON'T.  If after the 6-months her financial situation has not improved... then force her to make the decision. 

Hope your patients realize the sacrifice you making for them as well. 

Still NTA and best of luck.

> **OOP:** Yeah, I don't want to give her ammo that she could use to poison the well in the future. If she does not see the kids i want them to see that is on her and nothing to do with me. Sure she may lie, but that is whay receipts are for.
> 
> Six months is probably all she is getting out of me when it comes to this.

**OOP responds to a comment on if he will have enough money to support his kids' college funds while giving his wife the six-month budget**

> **OOP:** We are fortunate. Unless for college goes into the millions they will be fine. Though, I am also not telling them they have a college fund. I want them to work for their future, if need be I will pay for school that is the plus side of being a doctor. Very geriatric field I will always have generally high income.
> 
> Either way my hope is they push for scholarships and pave their own way but yes I will be a support for them if need be.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/dKlAzjkmmj): **September 29, 2023**

My fiancé has 3 kids (16M, 19F, 13M) with her ex, meanwhile I only have one kid with my ex, my daughter (14F)

My daughter is a state qualifying cross country and track runner. This means that her training schedule is rather intense, with her weekly mileage reaching into the high 70s and low 80s. At her most recent sports physical, I asked her doctor how often I should replace her shoes because I’m sure they get worn out pretty quickly with the amount of miles she’s running each week. Her doctor recommended switching the shoes out every 6 months, as well as get 2 pairs of shoes so she can switch out the pair she’s wearing every other day or so. However, her shoes may need to get replaced earlier depending on how intense her weeks get.

After the appointment I took my daughter out to a few athletic stores so she can pick out a few pairs. I told her to pick out 4 pairs of running shoes, 2 for track season and 2 for cross country. Then I told her to pick out a pair of spikes for her races. I spent over 300 for her shoes.

When we came home my fiancé saw the bags my daughter was holding and my daughter excitedly told her about the new shoes she has gotten. My fiancé stayed quiet until later that night while we were getting ready for bed she starting yelling at me for being irresponsible and a horrible person to her own kids. She said she was very mad because I should also get her kids shoes if I’m spending over 300 for my daughter. I mentioned that we agreed we would each provide for our own kids on our own, and her kids don’t play any sports. They all sit in their rooms all day on their electronics, even when I do buy them something they never say thank you or appreciate what I get them.

She got even angrier and now she hasn’t talked to me still, it’s been 2 weeks. How do I handle her anger towards me for not getting her kids shoes when I got my daughter shoes?

**Additional Information from OOP on his daughter**

> **OOP:** Money is not an issue for me. I make a lot, more than enough to live comfortably. My daughter’s passion for running will never die down so she won’t quit, she tells me everyday that she can’t wait for practice so she can go on a run with her friends.
> 
> Her foot size has stayed the same since 7th grade, she just started freshman year so I’m going to assume her foot size done growing. Also, as a runner, it is her responsibility to have a well balanced diet, stretch, roll out, and utilize her recovery runs and rest days efficiently so that she does not get injured. Of course injuries happen, but she does things so the risk is minimized and she has not had a serious injury in her running career.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** These are simply my opinions… 1. As a former high school runner of similar caliber… 5 pairs is a bit much all at once. Two pairs now, 2 pairs when track actually starts, and a pair of spikes for each season would have been fine (and is probably the right way to go ultimately). But buying them all at once probably is what got the shock factor ramped up for your fiancé. 2. As someone who has been in a relationship dynamic similar to yours…Any relationship where yelling and insults are seen as a way to resolve disagreements and conflict is bad news. I highly recommend counseling before marriage. On the back end of 2 years of individual counseling post-divorce, I know now how much we both could have used it beforehand.

> **OOP:** Thank you for your opinions! I suppose I could of waited, but I leave for a work trip in the beginning of January (which is when her track season starts) and I know my fiancé wouldn’t take her to get shoes even if I sent her money for it. It just made sense to me to get them for her now rather than wait. The track shoes are put away and ready for her to take out when track season starts. Though, I do want to say that money is and never has been the issue. It’s what I spent my money on for my daughter that my fiancé has issues with.
> 
> To your comment on therapy, she has been medicated for depression and anxiety since she was 20. She goes to therapy herself weekly but she doesn’t like the idea of me going with her.

[AITAH for buying my daughter a gift when I didn’t buy my fiancé’s kids one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IMKIu3X2s3): **October 7, 2023 (eight days later)**

My (30M) daughter’s (14F) Nintendo switch completely stopped working earlier this week. She got it the month it was released (March 2017) and has kept it in good condition for over 6 years. Yesterday she had her conference cross country meet, where she both PR’d and qualified to run state. To celebrate her new achievements, I took her out to eat and then bought her a new nintendo switch with a game she picked out.

My fiancé (38F) came back from her parent’s earlier today and saw my daughter playing with her switch. She asked me about it after my daughter left with her boyfriend and I told her that I wanted to celebrate her accomplishments in her running career so I got her a new switch as a gift. Fiance then got really angry and told me that if I’m going to buy my daughter something then I have to be fair and buy her own kids (19F, 16M, 13M) something too. I pointed out that I do buy her kids gifts when they reach goals and achievements too (for example, I bought my stepdaughter an expensive hello kitty necklace as a high school graduation gift and I let both the boys pick out two video games when they both passed their final exams).

She told me that it’s unfair I spend more on my daughter than I do on her kids because I make a lot more than her. Fiance then got angrier and accused me of not liking her kids because of the different financial treatment between her kids and my kid. She left with her two sons, but her daughter stayed with me at the house because she’s on my side.

I got a bunch of texts from her family calling me a selfish asshole for treating her kids differently when buying gifts. AITA?

**EDIT:** To answer some common questions, because there’s a lot of comments and it’s hard to get to all of them in a timely manner.

**“How does your fiancé treat your daughter?”** My daughter and fiancé don’t interact much. They’re both polite to each other, but they simply don’t talk much aside from small talk and my daughter asking her some questions about cooking food. I have mentioned to my daughter before that if my fiancé ever were to mistreat her, she needs to tell me and I will always have her back no matter what. To my knowledge, my fiancé DOESN’T mistreat her at all. They just don’t talk much.

**“Do you have a will or trust fund in place?”** I have a will set up that gives my daughter everything, my will is safe with a very trusted lawyer friend of mine. I also have a trust in place for my daughter, and she will gain full access to it once she turns 21.

**“Did you have this argument in front of her children?”** No, she called her kids down and told them what we were arguing about. I told them my side, and her sons took her side and left with her.

**“What is your relationship like with her kids? How are they with your daughter?”** My relationship with her sons is unfortunately minimal. I try to talk to them about their favorite topics or hobbies and they either ignore me or shut the conversation down as soon as possible. I don’t talk to them much either other than when they come to me for advice on things like school, friends, etc. My relationship with her older daughter is very good though, I’d like to think we are close. As for my daughter, she doesn’t talk to her stepbrothers much but she’s extremely close with her older sister.

Hope this clears up some things.

**Edit 2:** To clear up another few common things being mentioned, my fiancé has not always been this way with my daughter and me. She started getting much more defensive when my daughter finished middle school. I am not with my fiancé for sex, my sex drive is low and so is hers. Her children’s father is not in their life and does not pay child support, my daughter’s mother is not in her life either.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. You only replaced her old Nintendo Switch so technically it wasn’t a new gift. Also, you should be able to buy your daughter a gift and not expect to but everyone else a gift. How long have you two been together?

> **OOP:** We’ve been dating for 4 years, engaged for 2. I’ve known her for 7 years though.

**OOP should sign the prenup before getting married**

> **OOP:** She is against signing a prenup because she takes it as me thinking of her as a gold digger, which I don’t think she is. We are comfortable staying engaged.

**Does OOP get along with his fiancée’s children?**

> **OOP:** Her sons do not talk to me that much, I try to have daily conversations with them and talk to them about their favorite hobbies and such but they either ignore me or try to shut down the conversation as fast as possible. Aside from when they come to me for advice on things, but other than that we don’t interact with each other much (other than me giving them gifts). I would say I am close with her older daughter though.

**Commenter 2:** NTA, how does she get along with your daughter? Do her kids get along with yours? Do you all live together

> **OOP:** My daughter and her don’t really interact with each other than simple greetings or when my daughter has to ask her a question about cooking when she’s making food. My daughter doesn’t have a problem with the minimal interaction with fiancé. As for fiancé’s kids, my daughter and them get along fine. She doesn’t talk to her stepbrothers that much but she’s very very close with her older step sister, it’s great to see! When her older sister gets home from work they go out to eat and shop around and stuff. We do live together, the house is under my name, and I pay all bills as well as mortgage.
> 
>> **Commenter 3:** Your daughter doesn’t have a problem with it because she is scared of causing an argument and be hated even more than she already is out of everyone who lives in the house her daughter is the only one she gets on with apart from you that is disgusting she’s being isolated and ur allowing it.
>> 
>> You seem to not be bothered for your daughters well being she is ignored by the grandparents aswel so fiancé has a big support system and coincidentally when things don’t go her way they all message and call you and side with her, are you that scared of being on your own that you will subject your daughter to this constantly.
>> 
>> You are not your fiancés atm you can spend your money on who you want when you want, her kids are not your responsibility it’s not your fault there dad doesn’t have anything to do with them. When you get married you are going to be putting your daughter in such a risky situation she is already jealous of her if you do stay with her I can see your daughter turning 18 and leaving with this bf and having no contact with you is it really worth losing her over your fiancé.
>> 
>> I think you need to open your eyes or better yet stop making excuses for an entitled gold digger it doesn’t Matter if her family has money and buys things you have been enabling her behaviour and so has her family she thinks she deserves your money please leave her.


**Commenter 4:** She doesn't buy your daughter anything, does she buy her own kids stuff? How is the relationship between your fiancé and your daughter? There seems to be some projecting here. Her reluctance to sign a prenup is also concerning as she may not be a ""gold digger"" but she is definitely interested in keeping access to your resources.

NTA - It may be time to reconsider this relationship.

> **OOP:** She does buy them stuff, but not often I don’t think. The majority of the gifts they get is actually from their grandparents. They stay with them almost every weekend, and their grandparents buy them lots of gifts, they know how to manage their money well and they make a lot so there’s no issues there. It is just me and my daughter, I don’t have any other family and she does not have a relationship with her bio mom. My fiancé and daughter don’t interact much aside from some simple questions and such.

**OOP on setting up a will**

> **OOP:** I have set up a will that gives my daughter everything, my fiancé does not know about this though. Her kids don’t have a relationship with their father, and he doesn’t pay child support.

**OOP responds to a downvoted comment on having a 14 years old daughter at his age**

> **OOP:** I was raped. I didn’t willingly have a kid, I don’t appreciate that comment. My daughter is my world and I had a conversation with her about relationships and everything, I trust her, and I’ll support her through everything.

**Is OOP expected to pay for his fiancée’s children's colleges?**

> **OOP:** Me paying for their college has never been discussed. If I was expected to pay for their college I would refuse. I make a lot of money, but not enough to put all three of her kids fully through college. They’d have to get jobs. I can only fully cover one kid’s college, and that will be my daughter’s.

**Does OOP own his home?**

> **OOP:** Yes, my home and cars are under my name and my name only.

**Commenter 5:** NTA- Your Gf has a problem with your daughter and she is trying to use you as a proxie for her jealousy. She didn't care if her kids got anything, she was just pissed that you did something special for your daughter. Think about it, she didn't get jealous until your daughter became a teenager, is your daughter a real pretty girl? It sounds sick but she is a pretty woman in your life and she has no control over it.

> **OOP:** I didn’t think of it that way. My daughter is pretty popular at school, she’s got friends, she’s an amazing athlete and outgoing, she has a boyfriend who’s also popular and athletic. She’s pretty, but I never thought a grown woman would harbor jealousy over my own daughter because of her social status at school.

**Does OOP's fiancée work?**

> **OOP:** she always has been getting money from her parents, they’re well off and have always helped her out with rent, housing, food, insurance payments, bills, etc. right before the pandemic hit, she wanted to move in with me to spend more time with me.

[Update #1 - AITAH for buying my daughter a gift when I didn’t buy my fiance’s kids one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/mKXvGTtdGA): **October 8, 2023 (next day)**

I made a post yesterday asking if I was the AH because I didn’t buy my fiance’s kids a gift, but I bought my daughter one. I wanted to thank everyone for the positive feedback, and the kind support as well as the helpful advice I’ve gotten. A lot of people asked for an update after I have talked to fiancé, so here you go.

She came back at 12 in the morning alone, she said she left the boys at her parent’s place because she doesn’t, in her words, “want them in the presence of a man who won’t provide for them.” I sat her down and talked to her about a lot of things and a lot of you were right, this is not the woman I want to marry.

When I first brought up how she doesn’t bring anything to the table when I pay for everything, she didn’t want to talk about it and kept dodging the subject. I brought up how unfair it was of her to expect me to provide for her and her children when she doesn’t do anything for my daughter and the bare minimal for me. She doesn’t do house chores, she doesn’t pay bills (except her and her daughter’s car payments and car insurance), and she spends minimal time with both me and my daughter. Fiance didn’t say anything.

Then I talked about the financial and emotional abuse, she freaked the fuck out. She started yelling about how it was my job as the man to provide for her and her kids, when I make so much more than her and they have no father figure. I’m all they had and she kept bringing that up as an excuse for her behavior towards my money and how I spent it on my daughter. When I asked her what she expected me to do about my will or a prenup she told me that any good husband would put his wife above everyone else. She had been banking on me giving her everything I had for over a year at this point.

I don’t like yelling at all but I was at my breaking point with her at this point, we yelled at each other a lot. It’s not my finest moment and I’m ashamed but I realized that I let so much happen and my daughter suffered as a result of it. I told her about her neglect towards my child and I will not tolerate it any longer. She is my number one priority over everyone else and always will be. I don’t think fiancé believed me when I said that but I guess she realized I was serious when I told her to start packing.

I’m done being an ATM for that lady, and it’s crazy to think how strangers on an app made me realize how I was stuck in such a toxic, manipulative, and abusive relationship with her. My (now ex) fiancé won’t be a problem anymore, I hope.

I don’t think I’ll be with another person for a long time, but thank you to everyone for the support and kindness.

EDIT: My ex’s daughter will be staying with me and I will financially support her through college, and I will also help her get her own place. Her and I are on good terms and I want to make sure my ex will not be using her as a token to manipulate me any further.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Did she change her tune after you told her to pack, any apologies? Or did she just leave bitterly?

> **OOP:** She started crying and begging me to let her stay, no apologies though. I felt bad because she kept saying I was leaving her poor and defenseless and now she has to stay with her parents.

**Commenter 2:** So happy for you and your daughter to be rid of that toxic person. Most of the time it takes another person to point out something that you don’t see. That’s when you start to see that person in a new light. Rose colored glasses for sure.

Will you still try having a relationship with her daughter? Sounded like you, your daughter and her got along well. Sad her boys didn’t even attempt to play nice with you even after all you did for them. I bet their mother was manipulating them so you couldn’t have one. God forbid they like you more then her!

> **OOP:** Since her daughter is a legal adult, my ex doesn’t have a say in where she lives. Her daughter will continue to live with me until she’s able to get herself her own apartment but she still has contact with her mom.

**Commenter 3:** I may of come across as quite harsh yesterday but my intentions was to try and make you see how bad it actually was for your daughter and how much you was manipulated well done for putting your daughter above all. DO NOT let her friends and family bully you into taking her back good luck and protect yourself and your kid.

> **OOP:** your comment stood out to me because it addressed the reason why my daughter might not be telling me what really goes on when she’s alone with my ex. I plan to talk to her later today when I pick her up from her boyfriend’s house. I received a lot of harsh comments but I realize now it was necessary, I don’t think I would have been able to leave my ex if people on the outside were nice to me about it.

**Commenter 4:** Bravo for tossing this gold digger out. Bravo for choosing your daughter.

She left. The trash took itself out. And I think it may well be apparent why the first marriage failed on her part. just hope she isn't knocked up. And if you do hear anything about it make sure there's a paternity test. I just hope not because you will end up chained to this woman for a long time.

> **OOP:** I got a vasectomy as soon as I turned 18. I mentioned this before, but both our sex drives were low and mine was even lower so our sex life was pretty nonexistent. If she showed up on my doorstep claiming she was pregnant she would need to have some proof that its mine or I’d get a paternity and DNA test done.

#----OLD NEW UPDATE----

**Editor's note: the latest update is nearly two years old, and it has not been posted onto the sub**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/jTbsyPIroh): **October 20, 2023 (12 days later)**

I wanted to make a post to say a few things, mostly to answer some questions and also because I saw my posts get reposted in a few subreddits and they have gained lots of popularity.

I just want to start off by saying thank you so much to everyone for the kind words. Your support means so much to me and I truly am grateful for the community here, y’all have opened my eyes and have helped me a ton. Of course there’s the other side of the coin where I got some hate, a few comments of claiming my life is fake and bullshit, and then some weirdo in my messages asked me for pictures of my daughter’s feet. It’s not worth my time to focus on the bad side, but regardless, thank you to everyone for your input. All of it. The good, the bad, and the ugly.

A popular question I have seen get asked around is how the hell I got multiple pairs of shoes for 300. The answer is simple, discounts! A good friend of mine owns an athletic shoe store downtown so I went there. Got a discount because she goes to the local high school and because she’s on the team.. also because he’s my friend. I’m eternally grateful for him, he’s done me real good.

On the topic of shoes, many people have asked me why I have gotten my daughter track shoes now even though it’s cross country season. The answer to that is also really simple, I won’t be here. I leave for a work trip when her season starts so in my mind, it made sense for me to buy her all the gear she needs now while I’m still here. Though I suppose it doesn’t matter much now because her season is quite literally about to end, and then indoor track season starts shortly after.

My daughter and I are fine, I got her into therapy and I think it really helps her. Ex’s daughter is also fine, I offered to get her into therapy too but she said she’d handle it on her own time so I figured I’d just let her handle it on her own. She’s an adult and I now recognize that she’s capable of being responsible with her mental health, and recognizing when she needs to get help. Both girls know they can come to me whenever, wherever, for whatever. I did get security cameras installed and nothing has happened, it’s been peaceful.

Also to answer another common question, yes I became a parent at 16. It was not my choice but I’m glad something good came out of that situation. I work in a chemical plant and I’ve been working there since I was 19. I got extremely lucky with this job because, truth be told, I didn’t even go to college. I’m grateful for the opportunities I have had to be working in a good paying job with just a high school diploma.

Thank you again to everyone’s support!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Good to hear your daughter is in therapy and doing well! Any update on ex after she you broke up with her? Did she try and pull any gold-digger stunts or she leave peacefully to her parents?

> **OOP:** Nope, its been peaceful.

**Commenter 2:** When did the ex move out? How did that end? so happy to see you and the girls doing good!

> **OOP:** I kicked her out last week, as you can imagine, she was definitely not happy with that

**Commenter 3:** Good on you OP! You are a great dad and step dad! What was your step daughters relationship like with her mother? It’s interesting she chose to stay with you and the boys go. Did she favour the boys and treat them differently?

> **OOP:** from what I can tell, she actually favored her I think because she’s the oldest and is her first born. she did baby and coddle the two boys a lot though, especially the 13 year old.

**Commenter 4:** Have you tried reaching out to the sons? Sucks that they are the ones caught in the crossfire here. I guess there isn't much you can do if they don't want a relationship, but it sounds like they need a good parent (and probably therapy) more than anyone. well other than your ex of course.

> **OOP:** I have not tried reaching out, I don’t have their numbers anymore and I don’t want to contact their mom for any reason.

1o3afia,all,Trump is at it again. Black Friday is damn true.,"Today's market was outrageous. The SPY crashed the moment it opened, the Nasdaq fell almost 2.6%, and the Dow Jones plummeted over 600 points, all because Trump made a crazy announcement that morning about imposing ""massive tariffs"" on China, citing the rare earth issue. He implied that China was using rare earths to ""control the global supply chain."" The market immediately imploded. The algorithmic market crashed, and retail investors followed suit, panicking. Tech, semiconductors, and manufacturing sectors were all decimated. Ironically, rare earth and mining stocks actually rallied. Isn't that ironic? Didn't we just go through this in April? Back then, he also mentioned tariffs, sending the market into a panic, only to crash and then recover. This time, it felt similar, only louder and the drop was even more severe. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all. Having been in this business for 20 years, I've seen this kind of drama countless times. When the news breaks, everyone jumps on it, no one looking at the fundamentals. A company that was doing well the day before was slashed in half because of a tweet. I reduced my holdings a bit today, but I didn't sell. I kept some cash and will see how things play out next week. If it drops another 2% or 3%, I might start slowly adding to my holdings. This isn't a systemic crash, it's just panic. If there's anything I can really learn, it's this: don't jump in when others are collapsing. Black Friday is great, and everything is discounted right now, but don't buy everything. You have to figure out which stocks are truly valuable and which are just discounted junk.",Ornery-Highway-150,2025-10-11 00:56:19,2358,0.85,719,3077,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/stocks/comments/1o3afia/trump_is_at_it_again_black_friday_is_damn_true/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3afia/trump_is_at_it_again_black_friday_is_damn_true/,self.stocks,0,,,0,none,[],1628,48,,breaking news,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Trigger Warnings:** >!falsifying CPS complaints, manipulation, bullying, possible controlling behaviors!<

**Mood Spoilers:** >!sad!<

**Editor's note:** 

**Family Tree:** OOP, her husband, and three sons. Eldest son, Luis (32) is engaged to Jessa (36). Middle son, Cyril (27) has been dating Rosa (27) for 5 years. And youngest son, Jaime (22) is married to Lucy (20) and they have a daughter, Lettie (2).

**RECAP / TL;DRs**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/3pxhb14GG6): **July 31, 2025**

OOP and her husband have three sons, Luis (32), Cyril (27), and Jaime (22). OOP is navigating the complex family dynamics, mainly with her son Luis and his fiancée, Jessa. OOP is closer with her sons and their partners, but she feels uneasy about Jessa due to political differences and Jessa’s deceptive hostility towards Jaime’s wife, Lucy. Jessa made snide comments about Lucy, and there are tensions surrounding her wedding, particularly concerning the rehearsal dinner. OOP is conflicted about paying for the dinner, as she feels it may enable Jessa’s treatment of Lucy, but her husband suggests they should let it go to avoid conflict. She’s concerned about maintaining a good relationship with her children and their partners but doesn’t want to overlook behavior that hurts Lucy, whom she’s very close to. She asks if withholding payment would make her an ""asshole.""

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Wg9Y7dXqEi): **August 2, 2025 (two days later)**

After inviting her son Luis to lunch to discuss rehearsal dinner and wedding plans, OOP learned there are significant tensions between Luis and Jaime, which she hadn’t realized was so severe. Luis expressed frustration with Jaime, accusing him of being controlling and unsupportive, particularly regarding the wedding. This revelation was shocking, as both brothers had always been close, and she’s unsure how to proceed. OOP was not sure about making an intervention, as her husband thinks Luis and Jaime should work it out on their own, and she’s unsure whether to get involved in the family drama or let things unfold. With the wedding approaching closer, she’s left navigating her role in this difficult situation.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/rbxdSZ7gAm): **August 9, 2025 (one week later)**

Please be kind to me, I know that I have not been a perfect mother or mother-in-law and I know these issues aren't mine to fight, but my family is falling apart.

Last weekend my son Jaime and his wife Lucy went out of town for a concert. My husband and I stayed home and had Lettie and we had a great time (although they probably facetimed us every two hours all day Saturday!). Saturday evening Luis and Jessa invited us out to dinner, we told them we could go somewhere but would need to be home by 8 for Lettie to go to bed or they could come to our place and we could get take out and hang out here! I assumed they wanted to talk about the rehearsal dinner. They didn't respond until after I got home from church and my son just texted me and said ""we were thinking somewhere nicer, never mind."" Kind of odd, but whatever. Everyone got home safety but Jessa and Luis skipped our Sunday dinner the next day.

Then a few days ago, I was home with Lucy and Lettie, and Luis came over with Jessa to pick up the ring. Luis has this thing with Lettie where he'll walk in and say ""ring ring!"" and she'll yell ""hello!"" and then he picks her up and gives her hugs and kisses. But he came in and was just ignoring her so she ran up with her arms out and yelled ""HELLO!"" and he just walked past her! He got what he needed and they left but I was appalled! I asked Lucy if we should tell Jaime and she just said that we probably shouldn't - but how are you going to be rude to your niece (she's also his GODDAUGHTER) just because you're mad at her dad?

But that brings us to yesterday. I was out grocery shopping. Apparently **keep in mind I was not there** Luis came over to bring something to my husband, who was outside/ in the garage with Jaime and Lettie. Luis and Jaime got into an altercation that became physical. My husband says that Luis instigated the physical fight, but he's not sure of the rest since his only goal was to get Lettie inside. When he got back outside it seemed over and nobody was hurt but they were still yelling at one another. My husband told Luis to leave and when he did had Jaime go downstairs to cool down. I asked him what even started the fight?! He said he isn't even sure, everything escalated so quickly and I have never seen him so shaken in so long!

We don't know how we're going forward, but I finally agree with you all. This is Jaime and Luis' issue to work out, I can't blame myself and I certainly can't fix it myself. My husband and I told Luis he was no longer welcome at our home, and he lashed out at us, telling us we were taking his side and I told him listen, he attacked his brother in front of his child, they both deserve to live somewhere they feel safe! The other thing is that Luis works for my husband, and he's well within his rights to make him do a drug test

As for the wedding, I have no idea what to do. My husband says we should just give them the money we promised them and be done with it. That breaks my heart but it might be the only way. Jaime just has told me a few times we just need to get through the wedding and maybe things will work themselves out. I don't know if he means that to be honest. I'm just so sick, I wish there was something I can do.

I am trying to set up some time to spend with my middle son, Cyril, I feel bad that he's in the middle of all of this too and don't want him to think I've forgotten about him.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/0dEbXfdiHH): **August 14, 2025 (five days later)**

Update to not wanting to pay for my son’s rehearsal dinner because I can’t stand his fiancée.

I [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/mGQ5arwC5U) posted before, this is an update and this will probably be my last update and I apologize that it’s kind of long, I’ll try summarizing it at the end. I am completely destroyed about all of this. I mentioned in my last post my husband and I told Jaime he needed to tell us the truth about everything. Lucy was working and he put Lettie to bed so it was just the three of us. He kept skirting the subject, and I finally got so mad and told him, listen? You’re living in my home and now you’re physically fighting your brother, if you don’t tell me what’s going on, your daughter can stay here but you and Lucy will need to find somewhere else to live if you want to keep secrets like this. He got angry and wouldn’t answer me anymore, we fought a bit more and he went to bed. I told my husband I meant it and he was like I don’t know what else to do. Luckily my son came to us the next morning and told us everything (from his point of view). 

Basically, for the Fourth of July, we had fireworks in our neighborhood, so Cyril, Rosa, Luis, and Jessa came over. We still have rooms for them, and since Rosa’s dog was at her parents, they all had a bit too much to drink and all spent the night. Later, when my husband and I had already gone to bed, and they were all hanging out, Cyril and Lucy went for a walk and smoked a joint. I’m not saying I approve of this or anything, I’ve never seen her high but I’ve heard them make jokes because she doesn’t drink but I guess sometimes does smoke. So basically the only person who was fully sober was Luis, but he had just gotten lasik (couldn’t drive at night) and was a little out of it in general. 

Anyways, Jessa flipped out when she found out about the pot and started yelling at Lucy. She said she was a mandated reporter and since Jaime had been drinking she was endangering her child by smoking weed. Brought up that kidnapped British child, and just laid into her. Lucy got upset and went to bed and Jaime argued with Jessa. He admitted it got pretty nasty from both of them, basically:

* Jaime called Jessa out for her behavior towards his wife in general

* Jessa told him that she was just saying the truth, and it’s ridiculous that they call themselves married when they only got married because they had a baby and for insurance, and would be divorced in a few years anyways. 

* Jaime told her she’s just bitter that she’s still in her mid 30s and unmarried (this was low, she had an engagement that ended because her fiancé cheated on her with her friend) 

* Jessa then went for the jugular and told him that it was embarrassing for him and Lettie to even be in their wedding because it was trashy being so young with a baby and that Lettie would have been better off being adopted by a nice family who was wanting a child.

* Jaime told her if it was so embarrassing for her, his family didn’t need to go the wedding and it wouldn’t be anything off his back. He then went inside to go to bed. 

Luis followed him into the house and asked him not drop out of the wedding, he said everyone was just drunk and said cruel things, and promised Jessa wasn’t going to call CPS. Jaime still said he couldn't be his best man and that he didn’t want his wife or daughter to ever be alone with Jessa until she apologized. And that’s when the whole Lucy shouldn’t go to the reception so she can watch her daughter, and she shouldn’t spend money on things that aren’t Lettie stuff started. Lucy was really scared of rocking the boat and was just going along with it. Jaime had been trying to get to her and convince her that nothing was going to happen but she was freaked out. 

So of course I asked if he hasn’t told us any of this because he also believed that this was a problem? How often is she getting high? He just laughed and said maybe two or three times a month, he’s not worried, and she certainly not since the fourth. Weed is legal in our state and I know Cyril smokes often lol but only if you’re over 21. So Lucy has been embarrassed and especially hasn’t wanted my husband and I to know any of this.

I wanted to get my other sons' sides, and Cyril agreed to meet my husband and me later that day, and his version was the same as Jaime’s, almost worse because he and Rosa stayed outside and kept arguing with Jessa. (And I KNOW you all think I forget about my middle son, but he knows that he’s my drama free king who never causes me any headaches). I asked if he thought Lettie was being neglected or if Jaime or Lucy had a problem and it was a resounding no. He told us that he thought that Luis and Jessa were out of their minds and just looking for drama. Apparently after Jaime had left the fire, Jessa continued ranting about Lucy, saying she was inappropriate with Luis because in his phone her name had an emoji by it. [[I can confirm this, it’s a car because before Luis got his license back the joke was that Lucy was his uber driver.]] She also talked about not wanting me to watch her kids if Lettie was there because she thought that since her parents were teens, she’ll be a bad influence on her and Luis’ kids. Cyril said he and Rosa also want to drop out of the wedding, but Jaime begged him to stay on to avoid any more drama. Finally, he said that he’s tried talking to Luis as well, and as much as he blames Jessa, he feels like Luis has to be blamed as well more than anyone for going along with everything. 

At this point we were devastated and confronted Luis about his side. He continued to avoid the question, so I was very clear: We told him what his brothers said, and asked if any of it was true because I HAD wanted him to get a chance to give his full story without any bias, but he refused to say anything until I relayed what Jaime and Cyril told us. He didn’t deny any of it, actually has assumed that I knew about it, and that Jaime had told me and asked me to withhold the money unless Lucy was invited the wedding, which has been setting him off. I asked him if he thought that Lettie was being neglected by Lucy or Jaime - they live in my home and I needed to know if he truly believed that we had reason to be concerned about my granddaughter’s safety. He didn’t answer directly and was like see this is just proof that all you care about is Jaime and his kid, and Jaime needed to realize he wasn’t perfect so I asked him again! And he avoided the question, again. My husband asked him then and there if he could pass a drug test because he was ranting and getting flustered but not actually saying anything. He brought up some other things, including a specific, relaxed conversation that Jessa was a part of and I still have no idea why she would be upset by it. 

I could tell Luis was deeply hurt by that and I think my husband regretted it. Luis told us the only person we should be drug testing was Lucy and made us leave, but the next day sent over a confirmation that he took drug test at the lab we’ve used before and when we received the results he passed. Later this week, he handed in his notice (he works for my husband), he’s taken a position at a competitor. My husband is devastated, because it obviously means he’s been talking to said competitors as offers don’t just happen out of the blue in his opinion, but paid out his notice and that was his last day. 

During all of this, but after we’d confronted Luis, my husband and I started discussing how we would move forward. We knew at this point that the boys would need to work this out themselves, if im going to be honest, after getting all the sides of the story we were leaning towards being on Jaime and Lucy’s side (although we acknowledge the mistakes they made…) since it all seemed like a severe overreaction on jessas part after months of rude bullying towards them. We talked about possibly talking to them, booking therapy, anything to try to fix all of this, but on Tuesday our decision was made for us. It was possibly the worst day of most of our lives, I was at home with Lettie and Lucy and a caseworker from family protective services came to our home based on a report. We were all interviewed and they did a walk through of the house. I don’t know if we’re going to get an official notice or anything, but the caseworker seemed nice and told us she saw nothing to move forward on, but left some stuff about services for Lucy and Jaime. 

They are completely traumatized (and so am I if I’m being honest) and have been glued to Lettie ever since Tuesday, as if somebody is going to take her from them. Even Lettie can tell they are sad. I’ve spoken with Lucy who kept assuring me she only ever smoked on some weekends and never when Lettie was awake. I told her that I believed her (she kept offering to take a drug test), and even if I didn’t, nobody is going take a happy, healthy, and safe child from her parents even if she was smoking everyday but I can tell she doesn’t believe me. 

Jaime confronted Luis that evening (via text, he refuses to see him) and asked if it was him or Jessa, Luis told him it didn’t matter, so Jaime told him he was dead to him and blocked his number. Rosa dropped out of the wedding, and Cyril is staying on as best man but won’t attend the reception or give a speech. He wanted to back down completely but Luis convinced him to stay on for the ceremony at least. I told him he should do what he thinks is best, he says he still wants to drop out but is worried it might lead to something worse. He said something and was completely heartbroken but was kind of like well you know there’s still time for them to turn against me and try to ruin my life so we’ll see how this goes.  I think he’s trying to protect his little brother by not pissing them off more, but I can tell how miserable he is. 

My husband and I are completely broken about all of this. We told Luis that while we would always love him, but we could not support him or his marriage after he and / or his fiance wasted CPS resources to get revenge on his brother, and that he needed to come over and get the rest of his stuff (documents we were keeping for him, childhood stuff that wouldn’t have fit in his apartment) and to let us know exactly when he would be doing this because Jaime and his family were not going to be there. Maybe we shouldn’t have, but we confronted him when he came over, asking him again if he truly believed that his niece was in any danger. He told me that it didn’t matter what he thought, we’d always defend Jaime, who he said would get over it once this all blew over. I told him he very much would not be getting over this, and very likely he would never see his brother or his niece ever again. 

I don’t know if he didn’t realize before then how serious this all was or what, but he kind of backtracked, and told us to tell Jaime to call him. We told him multiples that wouldn’t happen, and he got angry and desperate before blaming us, saying that we’re the reason for this mess, we should have made Jaime figure his own life out and not babied him. I remember yelling at him that if he’d had his own way, I would still be doing his laundry and packing him lunch and to remember that he lived her for longer that Jaime has or plans to. My husband and he started fighting and it ended with Luis telling us that he was going to start his own family and didn’t need us, and blamed us for all of his problems. I was done with that and told him to get out if he was just going to say things with no examples or explanations to back it up. He didn’t ask about the money but I was ready to tell him I was saving it in case we would need a lawyer for all of his bullshit. 

I know it would be easy to blame Jessa, and it’s hard not to because I can see her influence in all of this. But my son is the problem and he (or his fiancé with his knowledge and support) has done something so unforgivable I don’t think he will ever see his brother’s family again, and it will be a long time before my husband and I want to see him  

I will always love him, and if I got a call tomorrow saying that he needed a kidney, a lung, bone marrow I would go straight to the hospital to give it to him, if he needed to go back to rehab I would go back to work and work nights to pay for it, and my heart feels like it has the flu or something because I know if he has children I’m unlikely to know much less meet them. But I can’t forgive him for this, and he hasn’t even attempted to apologize. I’ve never been so sad. 

In conclusion: Jessa got angry with Lucy for smoking marijuana on the Fourth of July and threaten to call CPS, Jaime defended her and attacked Jessa, which caused the past few weeks of fighting. After confronting everyone, Luis was acting odd and we asked for a drug test, he passed and quit working for my husband to work for his competitor, and then either he or Jessa made a report to CPS about Lettie. They found nothing, but Lucy and Jaime are traumatized, and we’ve all pulled out of the wedding. I’ve never been so sad. 

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** Looks like Luis feels Jaime is the golden child. Your posts also seem to suggest it.

While Jessa seems obnoxious, your eldest son has stated quite clearly you favor your youngest. 

So while this incident is his fault, I somehow feel you and dad created this situation. 

> **OOP:** Jaime simply needs us more right now, we’ve spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting Luis to get him to a good place, his brothers didn’t complain and say we were favoring him then. My middle son doesn’t think we favor anyone, Luis is the only one saying it. I’m sure we could have done things better in the past and we wouldn’t be here but here we are.

**Commenter 1:** Wow! Seems Luis feels you favor your youngest over him. As for the weed issue, in my state, even before it was legal, CPS wouldn't remove a child over that. They look at it like this: us the child well taken care of, fed, clothed, housed properly? If yes, then we have much more serious cases ro deal with. A report will be filed stating a home visit was made and all is fine. Usually it's on the parents records for about 5 years before it's sent to long term storage.

> **OOP:** Yes, that seems to be what will happen. It’s been hard getting answers about next steps because they keep telling them there aren’t any. We’ve never had to deal with anything like this before. It’s not like we’ll need to know to prepare or anything if a caseworker comes, it’s just more the constant threat of it now is causing them dread.

**Was there a falling out that led to Luis and Jaime's situation?**

> **OOP:** One of Jessa and her friends had a falling out, and the ex friend sent Jaime a screenshot of a text where she was saying rude things about Jaime and Lucy, he had confronted Luis who was telling him not to take it so personally, so Jaime said something equally rude about Jessa, Luis punched him for it.
> 
> Yes, I mentioned it in my post but not to my son.

**Commenter 2:** Welp you son just nuked his relationship w/his entire family so his fiancée achieved her goal of completely isolating him. Theres no coming back from calling CPS out of spite. You can keep the door open for your son if you like but I don’t see his siblings having a relationship w/him ever again. Hopefully one day he comes to his senses.

> **OOP:** I agree. I can’t ever full cut my son off but his brother can and I don’t blame him.

**Commenter 3:** I'd be telling him the door is open for him, but firmly shut for Jessa until she apologizes and gets the therapy she desperately needs.
 
> **OOP:** Nobody has any intention of ever forgiving Jessa, I can only not shut the door on my son but the hope of reconciliation between the boys is nonexistent. It’s almost like he died.

**OOP on how Lucy felt about Luis's accusations**

> **OOP:** It is sad because they were close, Lucy and Luis and she never said no to giving him a ride unless she was in class to at work. There’s no public transportation where we are (well there is but it’s not convenient but of course our area is still car-reliant). He was spending quite a bit on Ubers and she knew he was trying to save up to move out. She has been very quiet of course lately but even she’s admitted she feels betrayed. Luis was the first person other than her parents to hold, and even be told about, lettie. He used to give Jaime money to take Lucy out on dates and watch Lettie, they were so close and now might never talk again. Lettie asks about him every day and it’s killing me. I was not lying, I would truly and honestly give an organ to magically fix this.

**OOP on attending Luis and Jessa's wedding**

> **OOP:** We will not be attending, Cyril does not want to but wants to avoid further drama and Luis is putting a lot of pressure on him. He doesn’t want anything worse to happen, but won’t be taking pictures after or going to the reception.

**Editor's note: the latest update is over a month old, and has not been posted onto the sub**

[Luis confronted Lucy](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rhaenalicent777/s/rwluKjP7i3): **September 1, 2025 (2.5 weeks later from the previous update)**

I don’t really know why I’m posting here but kind of want to get it off my chest I guess. Jaime is out of town this weekend for a bachelors party so it’s just been the four of us. Yesterday I sent Lucy to take Lettie to pick out some mums because I love that little girl but I cannot bear the soda pop song again lol.

But Luis came up to her at the garden center and apparently started ranting at her about Jaime, as if Lucy herself had no reason to be angry with him. Telling her that she should leave him, that he’s an asshole, and that he (Luis) is getting the tattoo that they’d both gotten together removed. Lucy doesn’t even want to tell Jaime about it because we all know he’ll just be pissed off but I told her shouldn’t hide stuff from him. I don’t know, I don’t even know if I trust my own advice these days.

Edit omg I can’t believe I didn’t add the good news. I’ve been working to talk about good news more! But Cyril and Rosa put an offer on a house and it got accepted! And the best part! It’s so close - a 10 minute walk or a 3 minute drive! I knew they were looking but I had no idea they were going to make and offer! So close but not close enough to be a Marie from everybody loves Raymond ;) my husband keeps joking about how he needs to invest in homegoods because I can’t stop finding things I think they’ll like! (I get a receipt lol)

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I'm so sorry for what you and your family are going through. It's hard to see a loved one go on the toxic route and have to remove yourself from them because of it. I hope he comes around soon, before it's too late. You are an amazing mom and grandma, don't forget that.

> **OOP:** Thank you. It’s just infuriating! Luis used to be so thoughtful and considerate, and apparently he just kept saying things like oh I know Jaime is angry with me and Lucy was like - *i’m* angry with you! And he had no idea why she would be. I’m so devastated.

**Is there a possibility that Luis has a thing for Lucy and Jessa has suspicions about this?**

> **OOP:** I really doubt that. He’s known her since she was like 14 and he would have been almost 30. Luis isn’t like that.

**Commenter 2:** She did good, no point in engaging with him in his current state of mind. But you said Lettie was there and in your previous post you mentioned how she missed him and it was a shock to suddenly not have him in her life. Did he acknowledge her this time and how is she doing now in regard to him?

I assume that apart from this accidental meeting nobody has had contact with Luis recently? Is Cyril still going to be his best man? Btw congrats to them getting the house, bet you're looking forward to having more grandkids so near ;-)

> **OOP:** Yes he apparently acted normal and sweet to Lettie. I don’t know. I don’t know his problem.
> 
> Cyril will still be in the ceremony, but they don’t talk much. And he and Rosa are undecided about kids but just having them close will be wonderful

**Commenter 3:** I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this, I agree it is hard to wrap one's mind around the Why of it. I guess that's why you might feel sometimes that it's hard to trust your own judgement / advice, but from all you have been writing here I think you are really doing the best that can be done in the circumstances.

Not sure what to think of Cyril's involvement in the ceremony and what kind of message it sends. I remember you saying he is the drama-avoider but is him being the best man really avoiding drama in this case? You mentioned once they're holding sth against him and I hope this is not a big concern.

Please keep us updated. Reddit is usually pastime but I catch myself checking your profile every now and then because my heart really goes out to you and I hope for a good outcome for your family.

> **OOP:** Thank you. Yes, Cyril likes avoiding conflict but honestly it’s my youngest son that’s begging him just to do it so as not to create more drama. He’s not going to the reception or bachelor party or anything, he and Rosa have made other plans that night and Jaime and Lucy are taking Lettie to the Rocky Mountains for the weekend so none of us will be available.

**When is the wedding?**

> **OOP:** Oct

1o22957,all,My 80 year old mom thinks shes dating Elon Musk and sent him over 50k in apple gift cards while selling her house.,"Location: Washington, my mom is 80 years old, and recently I found a bunch of unpaid bills including a 28k mortgage on a previously paid off two story house with fireplace. The letter from the mortgage company shellpoint said she hadn't paid in 10 months and were days away from foreclosure. I paid 2555 to get it up to date but she still owes a few other companies thousand here and there. 

I investigated further, and she had started to sell but talking to her she said she has been going to multiple stores (Safeway, Dollar Tree) and buying as many apple gift cards as shes allowed. Its easily over 50k and when I talked to her at first she said she was buying them for a friend who she said converts them into bitcoin. I warned her it's a scam and she's being used. Last week she met with one of those ""we buy your house as is"" companies who offered her well bellow market value. I talked to the guy, tried telling him shes in no condition to sell her house and he disagreed saying thinks shes mentally competent to make this decision.  I finally convinced her let me see her ""boyfriend"" and asked where shes going to live now that her house had been sold. She finally showed me and  it's a picture of Elon Musk who she thinks is going to whisk her away in a private jet to some exclusive island resort. I asked why a guy rich as Musk would need money or gift cards she said governments hates him and has tied up his money.  I can feel my heart breaking because she fully believes this even after I explained deep fakes, showed her articles in the news of others who fell for similar scams and I dont know what to do. 

The title company said the company didnt send the money on time and that the contract is broken but company calls her every 5 minutes and is threatening litigation.  I can't convince her shes vulnerable and hurting herself or that she needs guardian. I reported it to the police, medical professional and elderly help holiness but they did nothing. Can anyone please help? 💔🙏",Suspicious-Truth5849,2025-10-09 15:54:11,2111,0.97,99,2210,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,/r/legaladvice/comments/1o22957/my_80_year_old_mom_thinks_shes_dating_elon_musk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1o22957/my_80_year_old_mom_thinks_shes_dating_elon_musk/,self.legaladvice,0,Real Estate law,,0,none,[],2000,114,,breaking news,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzvbim,all,Baby shower for an adult,"So at my last job, we had an employee in his 60’s find out that he had a child he never knew about….

….he took one of those DNA tests to find out his heritage and it connected him with a 38 year old woman who turned out to be his daughter. 

The mother chose to never tell either of them about the other so they were both shocked.

The day he came into my office to tell me the good news, he was overjoyed. Yes, he was upset that he wasn’t given a choice to be in her life, and sad that he missed so much, but he was oh so very happy to discover her existence!!

He told me, “Wow! I have a daughter!!!”

He flew across the country to meet her and her family, then he planned for her to fly out and meet his friends and bring her to work.

So I planned a surprise baby shower, ha ha! 

We set it up in the break room, catered food, had pink balloons and her picture up with signs and a cake that said “It’s a girl!!” 

She cried and laughed and so did he. 

One of the happiest moments I’ve gotten to share in someone else’s life.

1o20s65,all,Nvidia is literally paying its customers to buy its own chips and nobody's talking about it,"ok this is actually insane and I can't believe this isn't bigger news.

So Nvidia just agreed to give OpenAI $100 billion. Sounds normal right? Big investment in AI. Except here's what OpenAI does with that money. They turn around and buy Nvidia chips with it.

Read that again. Nvidia is giving a company $100 billion so that company can buy Nvidia products. And Wall Street is just cool with this apparently?

But that's just the start. I found [this](https://www.bain.com/insights/how-can-we-meet-ais-insatiable-demand-for-compute-power-technology-report-2025/) Bain report that nobody's really covered and the numbers are absolutely fucked. They calculated that by 2030 AI companies need to make $2 trillion in revenue just to cover what they're spending on infrastructure. Their realistic projection? These companies will make $1.2 trillion.

They're gonna be $800 billion short. Not million. Billion with a B.

And it gets dumber. OpenAI is gonna burn $115 billion by 2029. They've never made a profit. Not once. But they're somehow valued at $500 billion which makes them literally the most valuable company in human history that's never turned a profit.

Sam Altman keeps saying they need trillions for infrastructure. Zuckerberg's spending hundreds of billions on data centers. And for what? MIT just published research showing 95% of companies that invested in AI got absolutely nothing back. Zero ROI. Then Harvard found that AI is actually making workers LESS productive because they're creating garbage content that wastes everyone's time.

Even the tech isn't working how they said it would. Remember when GPT-5 was supposed to be this huge leap? It came out and everyone was like oh that's it? Altman literally admitted they're ""missing something important"" to get to AGI. The whole plan was throw more compute at it and it'll get smarter and that's just not happening anymore.

Meanwhile Chinese companies are building models for like 1% of what US companies spend. So even if this works the margins are cooked.

The debt situation is actually scary. Meta borrowed $26 billion for ONE data center. Banks are putting together a $22 billion loan for more data centers. OpenAI wants to do debt financing now instead of just taking Microsoft's money. This is all borrowed money betting on a future that might not happen.

This is exactly what happened in 1999 with telecom companies and fiber optic cables. They all built massive infrastructure betting demand would show up. Most of them went bankrupt.

OpenAI's CFO literally suggested charging people $2000 a month for ChatGPT in the future. Two thousand dollars a month. That's their plan to make the math work.

We already got a preview in January when DeepSeek dropped a competitive model that cost almost nothing to build. The market lost a trillion dollars in value in one day. Nvidia crashed 17%. Then everyone just went back to pretending everything's fine.

Even the bulls know this is cooked. Zuckerberg straight up said this is probably a bubble but he's more scared of not spending enough. Altman admitted investors are overexcited. Jeff Bezos called it an industrial bubble. They all know but they can't stop because if you stop spending and your competitors don't you're dead.

ChatGPT has 700 million users a week which sounds amazing until you realize they lose money on every single person who uses it. The entire business model is lose money now and hope you can charge enough later to make it back.

I'm calling it now. This is gonna be worse than dot-com. Way worse. Some companies will survive but most of this is going to zero and a lot of very smart people are gonna lose absolutely stupid amounts of money.

TLDR: Nvidia just invested $100B in OpenAI who then uses that money to buy Nvidia chips. AI companies will be $800B short of breaking even by 2030. MIT found 95% of companies got zero ROI from AI.

**[Areajugones](https://opencritic.com/outlet/470/areajugones)** - [Claudio Torres](https://opencritic.com/critic/7120/claudio-torres) - *Spanish* - [9 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/videojuegos/analisis-de-battlefield-6-el-mejor-shooter-belico-de-la-decada/)

>For a good war shooter to be truly exceptional, it needs to be fun but also have a great setting and atmosphere to create that authentic war feeling. Battlefield 6 achieves both, making it possibly the best war FPS of the decade and promising endless fun for its players in the coming months — or perhaps even years.

**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Alparslan Gürlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek) - *Turkish* - [79 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/battlefield-6-inceleme/)

>Battlefield 6 is a good first-person shooter game, but at this stage it has too many gaps that need to be filled with player feedback.

-------------

**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Kyle Foley](https://opencritic.com/critic/8332/kyle-foley) - [9.5 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is a fantastic follow-up to its divisive predecessor, and gets a lot of things right, while leaving room for improvement.

-------------

>Battlefield 6 gives the series' fans the big battle experiences they've been wanting, though it doesn't offer too many unique advantages in small-team firefight modes over rival military shooters.

-------------

**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Philipp Rüegg](https://opencritic.com/critic/10267/philipp-r-egg) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/39877)

>Battlefield 6 is sure to thrill new and old fans alike. Nowhere else are these huge, chaotic mass battles staged so well and so much fun to play.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Rick Lane](https://opencritic.com/critic/767/rick-lane) - [4 / 5](https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review)

>Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special.

-------------

**[Eurogamer.pt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/832/eurogamer-pt)** - [Adolfo Soares](https://opencritic.com/critic/8989/adolfo-soares) - *Portuguese* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.pt/battlefield-6-review-analise)

>Battlefield 6 returns to what the series does best. The campaign is just an extra, but the multiplayer mode shines with great battles, well-defined classes, and that classic war feel. It's fun and shows that the series still knows what fans like.

-------------

**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-battlefield-6-esplosivo-devastante-ritorno-shooter-ea-66239.html)

>We would have appreciated a more refined campaign in many ways, but that still doesn't overshadow the exceptional work done by the collective known as Battlefield Studios on the multiplayer front. Battlefield 6 is one of the most entertaining shooters of recent years and marks the return of the franchise in style. The class system, destructible environments, and wide range of maps and modes provide an extraordinary foundation for what's to come, considering that the plans for post-launch support are already well-defined and suggest the developers' desire to keep players engaged over time. Now all that's left is to get our hands on the highly anticipated Portal and learn more about the much-discussed Battle Royale mode, which we hope will arrive soon to make the offering even richer and more varied.

>Battlefield 6 takes the franchise back to the classic four-class formula and adds in new features to make the gunfights smoother than ever. With a short but fun single-player campaign and great multiplayer potential, this may be one to check out.

-------------

**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Tobias Veltin](https://opencritic.com/critic/3623/tobias-veltin) - *German* - [85 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/battlefield-6-test,3440847.html)

>As much fun as I've had with the multiplayer so far, I haven't had much fun with the campaign. I'm aware that they have even less weight in Battlefield than in, say, Call of Duty. But that's no excuse for what was delivered there.

-------------

**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Richard Wakeling](https://opencritic.com/critic/1425/richard-wakeling) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

>Battlefield 6 plays it safe but marks a return to form for the long-running series, delivering chaotic, large-scale multiplayer that's as familiar as it is uproariously fun

>Battlefield 6 is the best Battlefield entry in years, taking the fight to Call of Duty this holiday season.

-------------

**[Gamersky](https://opencritic.com/outlet/597/gamersky)** - 前朝刘沛公 - *Chinese* - [8.8 / 10](https://www.gamersky.com/news/202510/2024847.shtml)

>Battlefield 6 focuses all its efforts on the core elements-map design, environmental destruction, gunplay, and the atmosphere of war-delivering the spectacle of modern combat with striking visual flair. While it may not stand out for gameplay variety, it remains unmatched in overall quality within the large-scale warfare genre.

-------------

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Joel Franey](https://opencritic.com/critic/3423/joel-franey) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-review/)

>The occasional collapsing wall or exploding shack does add some spice.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Matthew Carmosino](https://opencritic.com/critic/10197/matthew-carmosino) - [8 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/battlefield-6-review-finally-a-battlefield-worth-fighting-over)

>Color me surprised but the newest Battlefield is genuinely good. With four balanced classes, steady progression, and a strong campaign, it's a refined and content-rich entry that should keep both veterans and newcomers coming back for more.

-------------

**[Generación Xbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox)** - *Spanish* - [95 / 100](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-battlefield-6/)

>I returned to Battlefield with curiosity... and I'm staying because I had a blast . If you had any doubts, there's plenty of firepower here for a while. And if the series is in your blood, prepare yourself: when the net closes and everyone fights for the last two points, that spark that only Battlefield can ignite returns.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - *Spanish* - [83 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-battlefield-6-despliegue-armamentistico-consigue-salvar-saga-aunque-dejandose-varios-frentes-abiertos-1486351)

>Battlefield 6 manages to save the series by bringing back a multiplayer mode reminiscent of the best installments. However, there's still work to be done. Some features are missing, and the campaign is severely underutilized. Fortunately, the foundation is in place for Portal and future seasons to round out a game with a future.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Simon Cardy](https://opencritic.com/critic/5521/simon-cardy) - [5 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review)

>A safe, dull reimagining of what Battlefield once was, rather a bold reinvention of what it could be.

-------------

**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Francesco Destri](https://opencritic.com/critic/3495/francesco-destri) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://it.ign.com/battlefield-6/221287/review/battlefield-6-la-recensione)

>Battlefield 6 is the comeback that fans of the series were waiting for: a campaign that's little more than adequate, but a thrilling, tactical, and spectacular multiplayer experience, although still needing a few final touches.

-------------

**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - Estrella Gomez - *Spanish* - [8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/battlefield-6/222072/review/analisis-de-battlefield-6-la-saga-resurge-de-las-cenizas-recuperando-por-fin-su-identidad)

>EA's well-known shooter franchise is back, and it's back in a big way. Battlefield 6 is pure addiction, everything players have been waiting for over the years. Although the Campaign mode is somewhat disappointing, it more than makes up for it with a highly engaging multiplayer packed with modes and customization options for our equipment.

-------------

**[Impulsegamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/31/impulsegamer)** - [4.5 / 5](https://www.impulsegamer.com/battlefield-6-pc-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is a perfect example of why I'm not the biggest fan of review scores as a concept. A middling at best campaign and some of the most fun multiplayer I've played in years make coming up with a suitable score challenging.

-------------

**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Steve Chambers](https://opencritic.com/critic/10017/steve-chambers) - [8 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is a return to its roots in many ways: an explosive warfare experience that puts you bang in the middle of the action with unique opportunities every moment and a seemingly never ending amount of customisation.

-------------

**[MKAU Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/860/mkau-gaming)** - [Hayden Nelson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9267/hayden-nelson) - [9 / 10](https://www.mkaugaming.com/all-review-list/battlefield-6-xbox-series-x-review/)

>Battlefield 6 isn’t just another entry into the franchise; it’s a full-scale evolution of everything we love about the series. From the moment you load into the campaign or jump online, it’s clear the developers have poured their hearts and souls into this game with every detail, and the result is something beautiful.

-------------

**[Merlin'in Kazanı](https://opencritic.com/outlet/661/merlinin-kazan-)** - [Murat Oktay](https://opencritic.com/critic/7098/murat-oktay) - *Turkish* - [88 / 100](https://www.merlininkazani.com/Battlefield_6_-oyun_inceleme-130367p1.html)

>Battlefield 6 pairs a brisk ~6-hour, vignette-style campaign with a multiplayer core that rewards coordination over heroics. Classic classes return; destruction hits hard. Weak AI, tight vehicle ammo, and a steep skill curve can frustrate, but with a disciplined squad, the chaos truly shines.

-------------

**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Alessandro Rindolli](https://opencritic.com/critic/8772/alessandro-rindolli) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3816/battlefield-6.html)

>Battlefield 6 delivers exactly what Battlefield should be - fun, content-rich, and visually stunning. Rising from Battlefield 2042’s ashes, the new Battlefield Studios title offer the franchise’s most complete experience yet. While some may miss naval battles or larger maps, this polished, balanced, and thrilling debut marks a powerful new beginning, setting the stage for an exciting future.

-------------

**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Diego Escala](https://opencritic.com/critic/2161/diego-escala) - [4.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/10/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is the return to form the series has been needing, and it truly is at its best here.

-------------

**[NextPlay](https://opencritic.com/outlet/897/nextplay)** - [Brad Goodwin](https://opencritic.com/critic/10643/brad-goodwin) - [8.5 / 10](https://next-play.com.au/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is a return to form for the franchise, one with a serviceable Campaign and a focused and incredibly satisfying Multiplayer mode that rivals the best in the series. The ridiculously good Destruction and fluid and adaptive Kinetic Movement truly make this one of the most immersive Battlefield experiences to date.

-------------

**[Oyungezer Online](https://opencritic.com/outlet/487/oyungezer-online)** - Çağdaş Erdem Nemlioğlu - *Turkish* - [9 / 10](https://oyungezer.com.tr/inceleme/battlefield-6-inceleme/)

>Battlefield 6 has finally recaptured that true “battlefield” spirit that brings the series back to life. With its gameplay, atmosphere, and technical solidity, it delivers the long-awaited Battlefield experience fans have been missing for years. There’s no unnecessary flash, nor any lack of content. In short, this game isn’t just another sequel — it’s a comeback that restores the series’ reputation.

-------------

**[PCGamesN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn)** - [Paul Kelly](https://opencritic.com/critic/857/paul-kelly) - [9 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-6/review)

>A host of minor and major improvements add up to make Battlefield 6 the smoothest, most bombastically entertaining entry in the series to date. A lacklustre campaign aside, this is a triumphant return and a must-play for both BF veterans and newcomers alike.

-------------

**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Mateusz Wróbel](https://opencritic.com/critic/7674/mateusz-wr-bel) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/385997/battlefield-6-recenzja-gry-powrot-do-swietnosci-ale-nie-idealny.html)

>Battlefield 6 is best divided into two parts - a story campaign that is unsatisfying in many respects and an excellent multiplayer mode that shooter fans will spend hundreds of hours playing.

-------------

**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Marco Aurélio Couto](https://opencritic.com/critic/9629/marco-aur-lio-couto) - *Portuguese* - [90 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 marks the return of one of the greatest multiplayer franchises to its glory days. With one of the best sound designs in the series, a competent destruction system, extensive customization options, and varied maps, the game delivers intense matches and immersive gameplay. The single-player campaign and some design choices may not please everyone, but they do not compromise the overall quality of this excellent title.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Tommy Holloway](https://opencritic.com/critic/6897/tommy-holloway) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-ps5-battlefield-is-back/)

>Battlefield 6 is a spectacle with jaw dropping visuals and sublime audio, while delivering their best multiplayer offering in many years. However, despite it being predominantly a multiplayer experience, its campaign plays it far too safe, and feels all too familiar.

-------------

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Aaron Bayne](https://opencritic.com/critic/8251/aaron-bayne) - [Unscored](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/battlefield-6)

>Battlefield 6 isn't worth buying for its campaign alone - although we suspect no one's really doing that anyway. For us, it's a nice starter while we're waiting for the main meal. It showcases how great the gunplay feels and how nice the game looks as a whole. But it's not breaking any boundaries from a narrative, mechanical, or immersive perspective. Did we enjoy our time with it? Yes, in a turn your brain off kind of way. Will we remember it by the time we're deep in the trenches of the multiplayer? Probably not.But, as mentioned, this is only a part of the Battlefield 6 experience. Once servers go live with real players, and we get some serious sessions out in the field, we'll update our review and score the game accordingly.

-------------

**[Restart.run](https://opencritic.com/outlet/940/restart-run)** - [Henry Stenhouse](https://opencritic.com/critic/11036/henry-stenhouse) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.restart.run/articles/battlefield-6-review?utm_source=OpenCritic&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=Aggregators)

>Battlefield 6 gets all the core basics right. Shooting, movement, driving, and piloting all feel stellar. The format delivers regular moments of movie-worthy, ostentatious action, while also allowing humble players to spend a whole game just repairing tanks, if that’s more their style. What remains to be seen is if it can deliver the sustained support, balance tweaks, and additions that a fine foundation like this deserves. And as a returning fan, I seriously hope it manages the feat.

-------------

**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/)

>Unlike many of the games in the series that have come before, Battlefield 6 is ready. While there’s a few bugs, none of it was impactful or detracts from the overall experience. This features one of the best Battlefield campaigns I’ve played. Multiplayer is focused, fun, and full of all the elements it is well-known for. Maybe I’m just an old, but Battlefield 6 has filled me with both joy and nostalgia of series’ past, though it doesn’t rest on either to be compelling. This is a new game that respects its past and embraces its future. Battlefield is back. Battlefield 6 is the sequel to Battlefield 4 that you’ve been waiting for since 2013.

-------------

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/battlefield-6-e-il-capitolo-della-rinascita-recensione)

>We are not yet before the definitive Battlefield and not a 1:1 clone of Battlefield 3. The general balance will still require work, and the hope is that post-launch support will introduce more varied and open maps. However, the foundations are incredibly solid. You can feel the passion and the will of DICE and the Battlefield Studios to get back on track, to listen to their community, and to give back to Battlefield the crown it deserves.

-------------

**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Hamish Lindsay](https://opencritic.com/critic/3171/hamish-lindsay) - [7.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-one-battle-after-another/)

>Rather than sticking to its guns, Battlefield 6 diverges from the formula. We could have had a steaming hot meal of scrumptious all-out warfare, but instead we’ve been served a lukewarm plate of I-Can’t-Believe-It’s-Not-CoD.

-------------

**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Austin Suther](https://opencritic.com/critic/5669/austin-suther) - [8 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale)

>Battlefield 6's campaign features a short and disappointing story filled with military jargon and not much else, but the multiplayer is the real highlight here. Multiplayer will absolutely keep players addicted with its strong progression system, vast maps, and outstanding gunplay.

-------------

**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [8 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/battlefield-6-review/)

>Following the disaster that was Battlefield 2042, Battlefield 6 comes charging in to restore the series’ glory—and for the most part, it delivers. While the campaign struggles with cramped design and cliché storytelling, the multiplayer absolutely dominates with massive, gorgeously-crafted maps, punchy gunplay and the kind of team-focused chaos that reminds us why we fell in love with Battlefield in the first place.

-------------

**[The Nerd Stash](https://opencritic.com/outlet/884/the-nerd-stash)** - [Amir Naseri](https://opencritic.com/critic/10158/amir-naseri) - [9.5 / 10](https://thenerdstash.com/battlefield-6-review-classic-combat-and-modern-polish-collide-to-create-fps-excellence/)

>A fun campaign, the promise of the innovative Portal, and absolutely sublime multiplayer make Battlefield 6 one of, if not the best, entry in a legendary franchise.

-------------

**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Jordan Andow](https://opencritic.com/critic/8998/jordan-andow) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/battlefield-6-review-pc-a-modern-classic-in-the-making/)

>Battlefield 6 is a true return to form for this beloved franchise, with improved gameplay, a substancial multiplayer offering and a fantastic (albeit short) single-player campaign. This game will be looked back on as a classic in the same way we look back on Battlefield 3 & 4 today.

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Harry Alston](https://opencritic.com/critic/8760/harry-alston) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-6-multiplayer-review/)

>I’ve had such a good time learning the maps, mastering weapons, and discovering quirks of Battlefield 6, and I can’t wait to see how the live-service model rolls out over the next few months. Battlefield 6 is a brilliant time, and one that, for the first time in almost a decade, has a serious chance of rivaling Call of Duty.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Stefan L](https://opencritic.com/critic/313/stefan-l) - [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is a return to form for the large scale shooter, with a great blend of infantry classes, mechanised warfare, some clever new game modes, and without too much nonsense wrapped around it. It's a true successor to Battlefield 4, right down to the naff campaign.

-------------

**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-6-pc-review)

>As it is right now, with the quality and quantity of content in the launch package of Battlefield 6, it is incredibly easy to recommend the game to anyone who enjoys multiplayer shooters. It’s an especially exciting proposition for those of us who just cannot keep up with Call of Duty’s rollerskates-based movement and its instantaneous time-to-kill. There’s finally a compelling middle ground between the indecipherability of tactical shooters and the yearly slop of CoD, and it’s one you won’t have to convince yourself to play simply because it’s there, you’ll do it with a big grin on your face because of how fun it is.

-------------

**[Vamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/761/vamers)** - [Edward Swardt](https://opencritic.com/critic/7464/edward-swardt) - [Recommended](https://vamers.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/)

>Battlefield 6 is not revolutionary, nor does it attempt to be. Rather, it is a measured reclamation of what once made the franchise great and offers a return to form that values stability and refinement over risky innovation. The restored class system brings much-needed clarity, while the scale and spectacle reignite the series’ trademark intensity. Despite some balance hiccups, floaty firefights, and moments of creative restraint, these rough edges never truly obscure the fact that Battlefield 6 delivers a genuinely satisfying experience. It may not redefine the genre, but it once again earns the right to call itself ‘home’ to all-out war.

>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play. The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.

>Battlefield 6 does more than recapture the feeling, it sets a new benchmark for the series. A return to classes and squad-based gameplay are met by excellent maps, tight controls, and an all-timer of a new mode, making this an unmissable multiplayer experience.

>Campaign Only: Battlefield 6’s campaign is an explosive, epic, and stupid 5 hours. Fantastic gameplay meets an annoyingly trope-filled story. Everything is so damned pretty, sounds too good, and plays too well for that to keep it from being a whole lot of fun.

>What can I say, Battlefield 6 feels like a return to form for one of gaming’s most diverse and explosive first-person shooters. The team delivered a gripping campaign full of political intrigue, great characters and enough “only in Battlefield” moments to last us until the next one. But for me, its strongest asset is its multiplayer, low map count aside there are modes here to tickle any shooters fancy. I loved this game so much, in my last match before getting off to write this review I just had the biggest grin on my face as I turn a failed helicopter flight into a parachute landing and a quad kill AND point capture. Only in Battlefield, indeed.

1o24jtf,all,"John's ""rat problem"" backfires massively.","In 2018 I was working at a computer laboratory in my town's University. My job was to simply oversee the students using the computers and help them with their printing needs and managing their Uni accounts. I was a secondary part time employee at this job and the full time employee, let's call him John (he was not my boss) was one of those dudes constantly flexing his ""intelligence and abilities"". He believed he was better than everyone else, but from his perspective everyone treated him as an underrated and overlooked employee who deserved better.

Since he was a useless POS who never really worked at all, his biggest fear was someone replacing him in the jackpot job he had gotten (it was crazy, the guy was getting paid to sit on a computer and browse the web all day, listening to music).

When I got there, he immediately saw me as a threat to his position even though he worked in the morning and I worked in the afternoon. We rarely interacted since I started my shift as he was leaving for home. The few moments we spoke every day, he was constantly talking down to me, belittling or downplaying everything I said, implying I was useless and unnecessary. Other people working at the Uni told me he was the most annoying ""Karen""-like person you could ever meet, making constant reports and complaints about minor things that weren't even his business and always caused trouble to the administration and the students.

One day John locked the door and turned the internet off so ""people couldn't hear through microphones"", and told me some ""rat"" was breaking into the lab at night and using our computers to farm cryptocurrency. The only people who had a key, were the two of us and the Uni's guard. He was intensely looking at me while nearly yelling ""THERE IS A RAT IN THIS LAB AND I WILL SMOKE HIM OUT. ONCE I CATCH THEM THEY WILL BE PUNISHED SEVERELY AND IF I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, I WILL BEAT THEM MYSELF"". I said, yeah sure, do your best to catch them. But relax on the corporal punishment, it's not your place to make any decision, that's up to the administration, to which he was infuriated and said ""THE ADMINISTRATION WON'T FIND OUT AND IF THEY DO, THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THE F\*CK THEY WANT, I WILL ENFORCE MY OWN PUNISHMENT"". He was clearly violent and/or insane and obviously convinced I was the rat from the angry glares he kept giving me. A few days later I overheard him say to someone on the phone that ""everything was in place"" to catch the rat and ""dispense punishment"". Weeks went by, he never mentioned anything nor caught anyone breaking in. I had this strong feeling that something was off.

Sure enough I searched around the office and found a hidden camera on the bookshelf right above my desk. John didn't install the camera to check the lab, but in our office so he could spy on me for fear I would somehow steal his job. The camera couldn't even see in the lab. Also he never got any approval from the University to install it, or notify them about people allegedly breaking into the lab. He had gone completely vigilante mode. I decided I had enough of his behaviour, but never told him I had found his little camera.

So one day I ran into our department's head and casually asked him if they had any news concerning the rat. He had no idea about the rat, the ""break-ins"", or John's anger and thirst for justice and told him how smart and responsible John was for installing a secret camera. I also commented about how ""we must change the camera's positioning, it wasn't even pointed towards the lab, just my desk, and we will never catch the rat this way"". The director was livid for the unauthorised camera and John's failure to report such a serious matter and the clear signs of vigilantism and violence threats.

John wasn't fired, but he was severely reprimanded by the Director and had many of his privileges revoked permanently. He was moved to the adjacent office with a large window behind his desk where people could see what he was doing on his computer (no more games and funny videos), and the cherry on top, he was forced to come in during weekends to personally check if the computers were accessed remotely from someone during the weekend for crypto-shenanigans. The guard was also compelled to check the lab several times every night for possible invaders which sucked, but it wasn't my fault, John was the one to mention break-ins in the first place. My contract ended soon after and when I left John was already miserable. He left the job a few months after me since he had to actually work everyday.

Welp John it seems your biggest fear of losing your dream job came true, except you were the one to stir things up and bring this on yourself with your irrational fears and recklessness.

PS: We never found the rat, if they were real at all.

1o0826n,all,Apparently two weeks notice is not enough,"So yesterday I decided to break the news and tell my current boss that I would like to put in my two weeks notice and that I have found employment elsewhere.

However, she tells me that I can’t do that and that I would have to stay an additional week (3 weeks total) to leave because she is going on vacation that week and would have to come in because they are short staffed right now.

Meanwhile, I don’t even get vacation time, (haven’t had anything since I’ve been there) and have been scheduled to work almost every weekend and for the remaining weekends of this month. (I’m full time.)

I wanted to get others thoughts and feedback on this because while I understand employers can’t legally force you stay at a job passed your two weeks notice, I would like to leave on a positive professional note, have references, and possible future rehire if need be.

Any feedback, suggestions, or advice would be greatly appreciated.",Striking-Tie178,2025-10-07 12:51:19,1170,0.97,698,1868,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/BadBosses/comments/1o0826n/apparently_two_weeks_notice_is_not_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBosses/comments/1o0826n/apparently_two_weeks_notice_is_not_enough/,self.BadBosses,0,,,0,none,[],929,41,,breaking news,,,,,,,,,,,,

1nzwuwk,all,Breaking News: Jehovah’s Witnesses in France warned of losing religious status:,"A branch communication dated October 6, 2025 was sent “For the Local Assemblies of Metropolitan and Overseas France.”

It reveals that on September 15, 2025, the prefect of Hauts-de-Seine officially notified two of the JW’s associations -the Religious Association of Jehovah's Witnesses of France (ACTJF) and the Christian Federation of Jehovah's Witnesses of France (FCTJF) — of the intention to withdraw their legal recognition as religious associations.

This decision is based on reports from MIVILUDES — the *Interministerial Mission for Vigilance and the Fight Against Sectarian Abuses* \- a French government body that monitors and reports on cultic and coercive practices. MIVILUDES claims that Jehovah’s Witnesses engage in practices that *“*undermine freedom of association and public order,*”* particularly citing ostracism and psychological pressure against those who wish to leave.

The letter warns that if this recognition is revoked:

* JW could lose their tax benefits and ability to receive legacies.

* The Council of Ministers could dissolve their religious associations, resulting in the loss of properties used for worship.

JW are urged to send respectful letters of protest to the prefect during the week of October 13, obtain contact details from their congregation elders, and make the situation a *“*subject of your prayers.*”*

>>He's clearing the countries debt, deporting illegal criminals, putting limits on people who are abusing our social support system. who the fuck cares about some stupid Epstein files.

>>>>You have no proof of Trump increasing the nations debt. You heard it somewhere and it sounded good to your bias ears.  You haven't found anything. Republicans protect our kids innocence while liberals wanna shove adult content into our kids schools. Liberals are the pedophiles
>>>>>""You have no proof of Trump increasing the nations debt""  Are you r*tarded?   We have trumps record from his first term. Trump increased the debt by $5T before COVID, then borrowed $3T to pay for COVID stimulus.   The proof of Trump increasing the debt is his first term track record, which is when he borrowed more than Biden did.   The proof is Trumps BBB and the increase in debt that he's already created for this term.

[Trump is like the old time snake oil salesman, a con artist. The way he talks has a hypnotic effect on some people, and they believe what he's saying, even though 75% of it is outright lies.

>Stop. They know. You're not helping.  Comments like this are exactly why even as Republicans are wrecking havoc, these people have nowhere to run to. Because when comments like this pop up as they open an eye to the Democratic party, it just tells them, ""You're not welcome."" THIS is why everyone is registering independent.  We're never going to defeat facism if we can't grow the movement. We grow by welcoming those who have made mistakes.
>>I’m not convinced they do know. It’s not like this was hidden.  Shame had its purpose in society.  I’ve personally suffered a lot this year owing to Trump and I’m far from being the worst affected.  So if someone who voted for Trump is also suggesting, then good; harsh, but maybe they’ll think much more carefully about who they vote for next time.
>>>How will castigating everyone who realizes they were wrong help to gain votes to win elections to get these people out of office though?
>>>>Well not castigating people is what Biden tried for the 2020 election and for the 2024 election the same thing has happened. Trump still got elected so maybe that has no effect.
>>>>>I sincerely don't understand why you see it that way.  Shaming, castigating and generally bashing anyone who shows signs of coming over from the other side and admitting they were wrong seems to be the SOP of leftist/progressive/democrat spaces online since atleast 2016 from my perspective.

>>>dude, companies hire and expand and some don’t, at all different times every year under all presidents. Show us a specific Trump policy that relates to that. Wow, accountants were hired. And some other company let accountants go. Your post is what we call anecdotal, and says nothing about Trump.  My company last month made more than it had in a while. But I don’t credit trump OR blame him for other months that were worse. that’s silly.
>>>>My original point is that the world isn’t crumbling. I’m not sure what policies they used to make their decisions, but just their confidence to expand just from trump being elected made my life better.
>>>>>The world isn’t crumbling, but our democracy/republic and the rule of law are substantially weakened by Trump. His seeking to entrench, with the help of SCOTUS and Project 2025, what was a fringe theory called ”the unitary executive theory”, is basically establishing a King, without checks and balances.  And how do you know it was due to Trump being elected? It could be coincidental. Correlation does not equal causation.

1o407xl,all,“She Is Human Embodiment of Everything Nauseating about Reddit” - r/TrueUnpopularOpinion Discusses Greta Thunberg,"## The Context

Swedish activist [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg), who [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) has recently called [a ""servant of the antichrist""](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/tech-billionaire-thiel-says-greta-thunberg-servant-of-antichrist/), has been in the news recently for her participation in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla in which 171 people in 50 ships representing 44 countries were detained. 

[She was recently released from Israeli prison and deported.](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-gaza-flotilla-activists-greta-thunberg-9de91cb4ab857180a30ef420c776c73b)

## The OP

I found this post from the profile of one of the only people with a positive comment on [the SRD post about the weird misoyginistic /r/stories post yesterday](http://reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1o3pbbr/on_rstories_a_woman_pretends_to_have_the_same/) in which they [left an animated gif of the Joker clapping with a incel-coded comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o2c97u/i_scammed_my_husband_into_liking_me_and_i/nio6m4v/)

## The Post

They post what appears to be an AI-generated blurb, titled [Greta Thunberg is a grifting opportunist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/).

> Her most notorious grift is being the champion of climate change. Remember her sanctimonious outburst, ""How dare you""? Well, she dared to lead a selfie flotilla that dumped 10-50 thousand tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. In the blink of an eye, she abandoned climate issues and became a pro-Palestinian activist, conveniently ignoring many actual genocides around the world. There were also multiple accounts of there being little to no aid on any of the ships, maybe a few gauze rolls here and there, but basically nothing else. With the recent announcement of a ceasefire in Gaza, what's her next grift? People like her can’t work behind the scenes, quietly pushing for meaningful policy changes—that doesn’t feed their insatiable narcissistic need for recognition and admiration. What cause can she latch onto now to satisfy those dopamine receptors? Asteroid impacts? Volcanic eruptions? No, there needs to be a villain. Perhaps AI so that we can blame billionaire tech bros.

> Edit: It should be mentioned that not once did Greta ever advocate for the hostages

> [You: ""She criticizes society, yet she participates in society. Curious.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nimn23z/)
> 
> > I’m trying to figure out the grift. Where’s the money? How does she make bank risking her life to bring aid and awareness to the plight of the Palestinians? Is she demanding that people buy her meme crypto coin like Trump and his wife are doing? No. There’s no money here. No money, no grift.
> > 
> > > Speaking fees, book deals, and merchandise sales are some of her revenue streams. Along with all the personal donations given to her from everyday people along with celebrities.
> > > 
> > > > She doesn’t need to visit or get near a war zone to have those things.
> > > > 
> > > > > I mean, it does help when your revenue streams are being a professional activist of the current issue(TM)

### Is she doing it for the attention?

> [I really don't think money is her motivation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nio3gcd/) She is 100% hopelessly addicted to attention though.
> 
> She comes from money, her basic living expenses are covered. She's not trying to ""make bank"", she's just stroking her ego while she's out there cosplaying as a revolutionary. She's basically your average celebrity, she just wants to be famous.
> 
> > Activists need attention. Quite obviously.
> > 
> > > Which is why people who crave attention become activists.
> > > 
> > > > True, but don’t act like you don’t want any attention either. In attention, there is love.
> > > > 
> > > > We all share the world together, pay attention to each other, love each other that way.
> > > > 
> > > > People who actively DISLIKE attention are usually only ones with fear of being judged from poor childhood upbringing.
> > > > 
> > > > Also, what’s your thought process that makes you think she’s “only” doing it for attention, or primarily? ***[Downvoted]***
> > > > 
> > > > > This is the kind of insane world view that only being raised on social media could instill in someone. Suggesting that eschewing attention is typically the result of a lacking youth is just you ratifying your own sorry addiction to Likes.
> > > 
> > > Activists need attention for great a cause obviously, no one disputes on that. The key issue laid out here is to discuss about how much of her activism is to fulfill her own ego, which makes her an opportunist.
> > > 
> > > > I prefer that kind of ego than Trump’s or Elon’s ego… ***[Downvoted]***

### There was no way for Greta to lose

> [""Risking her life "" oh...give me a break.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nisfodj/) She knew damn well that all the IDF was going to do to her was arrest her(there was no ""kidnapping "" ) , hold her for a couple of days while the paperwork went up and then deport her.
> 
> For her there was no way to lose: either the IDF would allow them through to take some pics of starving kids next to bombed out buildings or they wouldn't allow her through and she could screech about ""how the genocidal zionist IOF kidnapped an innocent person merely trying to protest a genocide "".
> 
> I do not approve of the IDF's conduct in Gaza and I am glad the bloodshed is over (at least for now) but let's not pretend this was anything other than a cheap publicity stunt by a washed up Z-list celebrity trying to cling to relevance.
> 
> > IDF snipers literally use starving Palestinian children as target practice as those kids are lining up to get aid, shooting them in the legs, head and torso. The Israeli military are a bunch of vile genocidal maniacs and I wouldn’t put any atrocity past them. The only reason the Israelis didn’t murder everyone on board those ships is that several navies have ships in the area deliberately observing what was going on.
> > 
> > > Citation needed for that claim... Also even if the IDF were the kind of genocidal maniacs you claim they are they wouldn't be dumb enough to kill international citizens at sea with no plausible deniability.
> > > 
> > > > Which is exactly why the Greeks, Turks, French and other navies have ships very close to the flotilla - to ensure that the murderous Israelis know they're atrocity would be watched and documented. They know the Israeli military is cowardly and wouldn’t commit their war crimes in full view of the world’s media - that’s why Israel has murdered more journalists than every other nation combined.
> > > > 
> > > > > The ships are there to save the activists from themselves. Again the IDF would have no reason to give a bunch of slacktivists thinking they're doing something anything more than a stern warning. If for no other reason that there's no plausible deniability : there are no enemy structures or combatants nearby.

### Greta doesn't advocate for Israeli hostages because it's not trendy

> [Grifting opportunist?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nimhhfl/)
> 
> If she is, she really sucks at it. She doesn't charge for speaker appearances and donates the lion's share of her income (book royalties, award money) to causes she supports. This includes many environmental causes, so she's not jumping from one ""hip"" cause to the next; just her public focus changes.
> 
> You may find her annoying and an attention seeker, but she isn't getting rich off her fame. You not being able to imagine anyone being an outspoken (even zealous) climate and human rights activist for anything other than attention says more about you than it does about her.
> 
> You seem bitter, cynical and jaded.
> 
> > ""human rights activist""
> > 
> > Why didn't she ever advocate for the hostages? Not even once. Give me an honest response to this without some non-sequitur whataboutism. ***[OP]*** ***[Downvoted]***
> > 
> > > Why didn't she advocate for the hostages? Because they have AIPAC and the world's media advocating for them.
> > > 
> > > > And the Palestinians have a massive Qatar and Muslim brotherhood funded propaganda scheme advocating for them. If she cared about people and not just trying to latch herself on to the latest trend, she would have advocated for the hostages also. ***[OP]*** ***[Downvoted]***

### Congolese people have never made what's happening in their country a big deal

> [""In the blink of an eye, she abandoned climate issues and became a pro-Palestinian activist, conveniently ignoring many actual genocides around the world.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/_/nimcsxg/)
> 
> Let me guess, you got this argument from that ret*rd, Matt Walsh? That's where I heard it first, anyway.
> 
> > Didn’t hear this from Matt Walsh. Whoever he is, it does seem like a logical observation. It does make me wonder, why isn’t the genocide in the Congo getting any media attention. Yet every major U.S. city, college campus, celebrity award show or media site can’t seem to stop talking about Gaza. Even Ukraine has taken a back seat to Gaza.
> > 
> > > Because Israel is supported/enabled and has its actions defended by most western politicians or at least was before the recent push against it. Add to the fact that immigration is currently the most divisive political topic and that the right claims it's not racist or islamophobic yet seems to have little interest in stopping these kinds of conflicts that inevitably lead to more immigration and they just so happen to ignore the atrocities commited against Islamic people but not Jewish ones (which in turn seems a bit islamophobic after all). So basically it's kind of a proxy war for the whole Anti-Islam/Anti-Immigration topic.
> > > 
> > > And all that doesn't apply to the Congo.

---

> > > It's cause there are a lot more Arabs/Muslims in the US than Congolese, I think.
> > > 
> > > Also I think Arabs/Muslims are a lot more nationalistic / care about their group in a noisy way. I have met a few Congolese people and they have never made a big deal out of whats happening in their country (though they acknowledge it's not the best situation over there).

### Greta is done playing climate savior for the left

> [This is obvious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nilt6l0/) Greta qot done playing climate savior to the left and has jumped on the newest bandwagon.
> 
> > She still donates substantial amounts to climate causes. You just don't know about it because she doesn't loudly announce it to the entire world.
> > 
> > > But never seems to shy away from the cameras.
> > > 
> > > If she never loudly announces her philanthropic efforts, how do you know about it? Are you in Greta’s inner circle?
> > > 
> > > > she has a foundation whose donations are public
> > 
> > That's so cynical. She might also believe in the cause, and it's acute, can't really postpone protesting for it. ***[Downvoted]***
> > 
> > > It's not cynical to call out Greta for what she is, a money grabbing, attentioned starved grifter.

### How would Greta feel about Trump? Plus a discussion on the IDF and how women share the blame for getting sexually assaulted

> [Wonder how she feels about the news that Trump of all people brokered a peace deal in Gaza, with Palestinians and Israelis celebrating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nim03l3/) Humanitarian aid will also be allowed to flood in during the cease fire because of cooperation between Hamas and the IDF. Greta will probably credit her flotilla for all this happening.
> 
> > You're counting chickens. Israel still has to vote on the ceasefire. Multiple ceasefires have been announced and Israel inevitably finds (if they even bother) an excuse to break it and resume bombing or shooting up food lines. ***[Downvoted]***
> > 
> > > Who are the people more likely to break the ceasefire? A)The people who glorify death, martydom, shaheeds, a charter that still calls for the destruction of Israel, or B)People who celebrate life and just want to be left alone? ***[OP]***
> > > 
> > > > Historically? The IDF. And I'm talking about the Israeli state, don't twist it to make it sound like I'm referring to the Israeli people. ***[Downvoted]***
> > > > 
> > > > > The IDF is the Israeli people. ***[OP]***
> > > > > 
> > > > > > The IDF is made up of Israelis, but doesn't include the entire country. There are plenty that refuse mandatory service and/or oppose the genocide. It's kinda fucked up for you to conflate the entire Israeli population with the IDF.
> > > > > > 
> > > > > > > And Hamas fighters who kidnapped and killed people on October 7 weren’t committing a genocide? Their stated goal is to eradicate Israel. From the river to the sea isn’t exactly a call for peace and to seek a two-state solution. And see how Hamas treats the LGBTQ+ community under their sharia law in Gaza. Spoiler: it’s not good.

*[This continues for a while]*

> > > Releasing 2,000 Palestinian prisoners (many with life sentences as convicted terrorists) for the release of 48 hostages (many of which may be dead and only are returning as corpses) is a pretty big concession from Israel.
> > > 
> > > > No, it's not. They do that with every prisoner exchange. They'll release hundreds of Palestinians they've nearly tortured to death just to get a single Israeli back. It's not them being generous or making a concession. It's to demonstrate that they see Palestinian lives as having a tiny fraction of the value of an Israeli life. They're also secure in knowing that those prisoners will soon die from the famine or a resumed bombing campaign.
> > > > 
> > > > These are 2000 people the IDF has been claiming are Hamas terrorists as an excuse for detaining them. Why would they release 2000 Hamas fighters if their stated goal is to eliminate Hamas entirely? ***[Downvoted]***

*[Cont'd]*

> That's a ridiculous outlook on the situation. People in Israel didn't exactly like the Gilad Shalit trade (where Israel released 1000 terrorists for one person). This has been the result of Hamas extorting Israel by dekanding more and more prisoners beibg released, and the government feeling obligated to save its people and so agreeing to extortionist deals. Claiming it is for ""show"", to tell everyone Israeli lives are worth more, is completely detached from reality and is like saying ""women who dress provocatively are to blame for being raped"".
> 
> And now, I am going to say something that might be slightly controversial: I do think women share a responsibility, in that they shouldn't dress provocatively. But the rapists are still rapists.
> 
> And the reason they are releasing 2000 Hamas fighters if their stated goal is to eliminate Hamas entirely is that eliminating Hamas entirely is not, and has never been, an actually feasible goal. The war would simply go on forver if they actually tried to do that. It's time to make peace and it's time to get the hostages back, so even if it's extremely painful to have to release terrorists (and btw, this is like one of the most debated issues in Israel right now), they are facing a lot of internal pressure (from the hostages' families) to do it. At the same time a lot of the populace is against it because they fear these released terrorists would commit more terrorism, just like happened 2 years ago (with those released on the Gilad Shalit deal).

### Greta is baiting the cops

> [She is a complete grifter who wanted to cosplay being “kidnapped” when in reality she was respectfully and rightfully detained, and while there are actual Israeli civilian HOSTAGES languishing in Gazan captivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nimzd3g/)
> 
> > And she smirks every time she manages to bait cops into forcibly removing her from somewhere. It's like she gets off to playing ""victimized righteous activist.""

### Hilarious to see all the triggered libs

> [This isn’t unpopular at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nilqboi/) she’s literally among the most useless and obnoxious humans in the planet.

### She's autistic and has a weird haircut!

*Editors Note: Greta skipped school for a few years to focus on activism but graduated in 2023.*

> [Greta Thunberg is an autistic high school dropout and an authority of nothing. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nilpz9w/) But I do love the new haircut! 🤣🤣🤣

### How is that climate change disaster going?

> [She brings attention to important issues and you all cannot stop obsessing over her, so I would say she is a pretty damn successful activist.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nilr3d7/)
> 
> > Successful activist would get results. She raised awareness about climate change, but as her gloom and doom deadline passed and the world didn’t end, it harmed the climate change cause. This time her flotilla had zero impact, yet it was Trump who brokered a cease fire and got humanitarian aid flowing back into Gaza today. If Trump gets the Nobel Prize for this, Greta will have a tantrum.
> > 
> > > Her goal is to raise awareness to the issues and to get/keep people talking about them. It is undeniably the case that she has been successful in doing this. The flotilla kept the topic in the news for several weeks. Your rather petty insistence that she will be upset if a peace deal is brokered is pathetic, I am sure that she will be very happy to see the thing she has been trying to bring awareness to be resolved. ***[Downvoted]***
> > > 
> > > > So how’s that climate change disaster going? Greta made people aware of it, then ironically quit talking about it herself.
> > > > 
> > > > > There is massive action being taken around the world to curb the effects of climate change. It also may shock you to know that people can care about more than one thing at once. ***[Downvoted]***

### Greta and the Flotilla are Antisemitic

> [You know what’s really bad for the environment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/ninfyfn/) War. Genocide. Colonialism.
> 
> She hasn’t abandoned anything - she’s going at the causes not just the symptom.  
> 
> Which is what she’s said and is fairly obvious.
> 
> > She’s going after the Jews because she and her fellow flotilla mates are anti-Semitic.
> > 
> > Sarah Wilkinson is a holocaust denier and said “Israelis are not human. They have arms and a face, but they are not one of us.”
> > 
> > That’s your humanitarians right there for you.
> > 
> > > She’s not going after “the Jews”. Please do not conflate Israel and all Jews.  That’s something Israel does as a cover and it’s making the world less safe for Jewish people everywhere.  There are large numbers of Jews in and out of Israel who don’t  support the erasure of Palestine.  
> > > 
> > > The state of Israel is actively committing war crimes against Palestinians.  They illegally  abducted and detained the flotilla in international waters. They were civilians carrying aid.  
> > > 
> > > Israel will literally use Nazi propaganda that was used against Jews in WW2 to describe Palestinians.  That’s fucked up.
> > > 
> > > > Wait, so are you telling me that Israel is now responsible for the anti-semitism in the world lol? That’s a doozy. Also, denying the holocaust has nothing to do with Israel. That is almost always rooted in hatred of Jews
> > > > 
> > > > > No that’s not at all what I said.  Anti semitism is real and dangerous.  And Israel’s current genocide is creating more danger. 
> > > > > 
> > > > > I didn’t mention the Holocaust?  But Never Again means for anyone.  Using almost verbatim justification for killing kids (so they don’t grow up to be problems) that the Nazis used is FUCKED.

*[Cont'd]*

> Flotilla members and Greta’s compadre is a holocaust denier. That is about Jews, not Israel
> 
> > I saw Debra Messing post some nonsense about one of the activists having heroin in her coochie.   Which is hilariously untrue. 
> > 
> > Even if one of the hundreds of volunteers and activists who are risking their lives to bring aid into Gaza is a Holocaust denier (which is repugnant) it doesn’t make the goals anti semitic.  I can only find any talk of a denier on Reddit.
> > 
> > > So if a holocaust denied is supporting one side of the war and not calling for the release of the hostages and not praising or expressing relief for the peace deal, then there’s nothing to see there or to be skeptical about? You have to be kidding me. The selective outrage and bias with you people is amazing
> > > 
> > > > Let me say it again. You say there is 1 denier in a group of hundreds.  I can find no evidence of this off of Reddit. (Share something that’s not from Israel?)
> > > > 
> > > > Not gonna trash a whole humanitarian aid campaign full of activists with food and medicine that have been illegally kidnapped by Israel for one vague Reddit accusation.
> > > > 
> > > > I’m going to need some real proof for more than 1 person when I know the background of dozens of others. 
> > > > 
> > > > What you people will do to try and change the story from genocide is amazing.
> > > > 
> > > > > If it is a genocide, and that is their true intention, why would they ever agree to a peace deal? Make that make sense to me.

### OP tells a sarcastic commenter they've donated to various IDF causes

> [Oh no.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nir84r1/) A young woman who cares about stuff and actually does something about it.

### She just wanted to take a sailing trip

> [She should be more like OP and do nothing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1o27eww/greta_thunberg_is_a_grifting_opportunist/nim4r2j/) Maybe whinge on the Internet a bit and not get too invested in the ongoing genocide of an entire people. That's just showing off.

> 
> > She already does nothing, all she did was take a fucking sailing trip. People claim she was “bringing attention to the problem”. You mean the war that is front page news daily? This was a narcissistic vanity trip, nothing else. It aided nothing but Greta’s ego.
> > 
> > > The fact she brings attention by being there says enough. You think shes doing nothing but people made her a public figure which by actively participating shes doing a lot
> > > 
> > > > This war has no need of any more promotion, it is already a daily discussion across the world. The only reason she went was to boost her ego.

1nzyjpu,all,"Best ways to prevent and repair oral diseases. Periodontitis, Caries, Gingivitis, Receding Gums are linked to heart disease and Alzheimer’s. Here is how to fight and beat them with scientific evidence for oral health.","Most people don’t realize how deeply oral health is tied to the rest of the body. Your mouth is not just where your smile begins. It’s the entrance to your entire system. When your gums are inflamed, or when harmful bacteria take over, that inflammation travels through the blood and affects your heart, your brain, and even your lifespan. Studies show that gum disease and poor oral health are directly linked to heart disease, diabetes, and even Alzheimer’s. But the great news is: you can fight back. With science, nutrition, and a little daily discipline, you can keep your mouth young, clean, and full of life for decades to come.

It all begins with brushing and flossing. The foundation of everything. Every day, bacteria build up in your mouth, forming a sticky film called plaque. This film is home to dangerous microbes like Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis that cause caries and periodontitis. Brushing twice a day with a soft toothbrush and a good toothpaste (either fluoride or nano-hydroxyapatite) helps remove this biofilm before it hardens into tartar. The newer nano-hydroxyapatite pastes don’t just clean; they actually rebuild your enamel naturally, filling in micro-cracks without any toxicity. Flossing or using a water flosser daily removes what your toothbrush can’t reach, saving your gums from bleeding, swelling, and decay.

The next step is keeping your oral microbiome in balance: the invisible world of good bacteria that protect your mouth. Many people still kill their own protection by using strong antibacterial (alcohol) mouthwashes every day. That’s a mistake. Instead of killing all bacteria, nurture the good ones. Probiotic lozenges with Lactobacillus reuteri can actually heal gums and fight bad breath. Eating fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi adds friendly bacteria that protect your gums and stop harmful microbes from spreading. A healthy microbiome doesn’t just mean a clean mouth. It means lower inflammation throughout your whole body.

Sugar is one of the biggest enemies of your teeth. When you eat sugar or refined carbs often, bacteria in your mouth turn them into acids that eat away your enamel. You don’t need to cut everything sweet, but try to eat sugary foods only with meals, not between them. Rinse your mouth with water afterward, or chew xylitol gum: it neutralizes acids and stops the bad bacteria from sticking to your teeth. Every small step like this adds up to stronger enamel and fewer cavities.

Saliva is your mouth’s natural defense system. And it’s often forgotten. It neutralizes acid, delivers minerals like calcium and phosphate, and washes away bacteria. If your mouth feels dry, bacteria grow faster. Stay hydrated, chew sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva, and make sure you get enough vitamin A, zinc, and magnesium to keep your salivary glands healthy. Avoid smoking and mouth breathing: both dry out your mouth and cause damage over time. A moist mouth is a living, self-healing mouth.

Healthy gums are everything. They hold your teeth in place and protect your bloodstream from infection. Gingivitis and periodontitis start small (a little bleeding when brushing) but if ignored, they can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. Worse, the same bacteria can travel to your arteries and brain, contributing to heart disease and dementia. Keep your gums firm and pink by flossing daily, using short-term antibacterial rinses when needed, and eating foods rich in vitamin C, CoQ10, and omega-3s. These nutrients reduce inflammation and help gums repair. Low-level laser therapy is also an amazing modern tool that helps regenerate gum tissue naturally and speed up healing.

Everything in your mouth thrives in balance. Even the pH level matters. When your mouth becomes too acidic (below 5.5 pH), enamel starts to dissolve. Rinse your mouth with water after meals, avoid constant acidic drinks like soda and citrus, and eat alkaline foods like spinach, cucumbers, and greens. These simple habits keep your mouth in an environment where enamel can rebuild instead of breaking down.

If damage has already happened, don’t lose hope. Science can repair it. Early cavities can be remineralized using nano-hydroxyapatite, fluoride varnish, or CPP-ACP creams. Gum tissues can be regenerated with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and stem-cell therapies that use your body’s own growth factors. Even receding gums can be restored using new surgical techniques like the pinhole method and collagen grafts. Laser therapy, vitamin D3 + K2, and proper nutrition all help the bone and tissue grow stronger again. We are living in a time when regeneration isn’t just a dream. It’s real, and it’s growing every year.

Nutrition is your secret weapon for strong teeth and gums. Vitamins D3 and K2 keep calcium in your bones and teeth, not in your arteries. Vitamin C helps your gums produce collagen, zinc and selenium repair tissues, and omega-3s calm inflammation. Add collagen peptides for extra strength in the connective tissues that hold your teeth. A diet rich in vegetables, healthy fats, and clean proteins doesn’t just help your body. It makes your smile glow with real vitality.

Your smile is a reflection of your whole body’s health. Brush, floss, eat well, and keep your stress low. Because high cortisol and inflammation weaken your gums and immune system. Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and early checkups. Remember, oral health is longevity health. The same habits that protect your gums also protect your heart and brain. So every time you take care of your mouth, you are adding years to your life. And life to your years. Healthy gums, strong teeth, and a balanced microbiome mean not just a beautiful smile, but a healthier, longer, and sharper mind for decades to come.",GarifalliaPapa,2025-10-07 04:41:12,897,0.99,36,933,text,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,/r/immortalists/comments/1nzyjpu/best_ways_to_prevent_and_repair_oral_diseases/,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1nzyjpu/best_ways_to_prevent_and_repair_oral_diseases/,self.immortalists,0,,Creator of immortalists,0,none,[],5785,217,,breaking news,,,,,,,,,,,,
