I went to a doctors appointment once and there was sheet to fill out about all my medical history and such, but at the bottom there was a box to check if I wanted the doctor to speak with me in private. I checked that because at the time I was taking birth control without my mom knowing because I was so afraid of her finding out, but knew I should let the doctor know of the medications I‚Äôm taking so I just wanted to talk about it in private. 

Well, mom comes back with me to room and doc completely ignored the box I checked that stated I would need to speak to them privately and goes on to ask aloud ‚ÄúI see here you‚Äôre taking (insert BC name here), is that correct?‚Äù and I was just mortified.

The actors also didn‚Äôt give much thought to the clause that Haxan would have the right to use their real names ‚Äúfor the purpose of this film,‚Äù rather than the generic ones ‚Äî Jane, Bill and John ‚Äî originally assigned to their characters. The filmmakers explained that the footage they were going to shoot would comprise roughly 10 minutes of a fictional documentary about their characters‚Äô purported disappearance while seeking evidence of the fabled Blair Witch. Using their real names would make it feel that much more authentic.  
...  
It wasn‚Äôt until roughly a year later that the cast learned that the filmmakers had changed course and made their footage into the entire movie...  
...When Donahue went to the studio‚Äôs New York office to try to talk to executives, she was sent away with some swag.

On the eve of the October 2000 release of ‚ÄúBlair Witch 2,‚Äù Donahue rallied Williams and Leonard to sue Artisan.

More detailed explanation:

> Ake, a Swedish sailor, relieved his tedium at sea one day in 1955 by writing a letter. ""To Someone'Beautiful and Far Away,"" he poetically inscribed it. After giving his home address and a brief description of himself, he added, ""Write to me, whoever you are,"" and signed his name. With that, he tucked the paper into an empty bottle of aqua vitae, replaced its cork and tossed it overboard. Two years went by. Then, on his return from another voyage, he found a letter, postmarked Syracuse, Sicily. The message was in Italian, which one of his shipmates obligingly translated. It was from a 17-year-old girl, who wrote: ""Last Tuesday, I found a bottle on the shore. Inside was a piece of paper, bearing writing in a strange language. I took it to our priest, who is a great scholar. He said the language was Swedish and, with the help of a dictionary, he read me your charming letter. I am not beautiful, but it seems so miraculous that this little bottle should have traveled so far and long to reach me that I must send you an answer ..."" Other letters, consigned to ordinary post, followed the first two. Photographs were exchanged and, finally, vows. Ake set sail for Syracuse and now, together, he and his pretty, if not beautiful, correspondent, who has just turned 18, are embarked on the sea of matrimony.

Kind of looks like a dating app, but with bottles and letters and no one ghosting or blocking you. Ok, it doesn't look like a dating app.",6897,2025-10-09 23:36:43,False,none,0,0

nisa7cb,1o33luu,chrisdh79,"From the article: Sean Duffy, the former reality TV host and current Secretary of Transportation, is upset with air traffic controllers who are calling out sick during the government shutdown, which has caused a surge in delays at airports across the country. On Thursday, Duffy threatened to fire those who aren‚Äôt showing up to work, calling them ‚Äúproblem children.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,‚Äù Duffy told Fox Business host Stuart Varney.

Duffy then pivoted into partisan talking points about Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the U.S. Senate, who has been asking for Republicans to negotiate on health care to secure Democratic votes to reopen the government, which was shut down on Oct. 1.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre lashing out at Chuck Schumer,‚Äù Duffy bizarrely insisted of the air traffic controllers. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre frustrated that Chuck Schumer is putting illegal immigrants and their health care over their paychecks, putting illegals over Americans. And they‚Äôre like, you know what? We‚Äôre going to call in sick today.‚Äù

The idea that Democrats want to give health care to undocumented immigrants to reopen the government is untrue and has been debunked by countless major media outlets. But it‚Äôs a common line of attack from President Donald Trump and his allies like Duffy.

In reality, Democrats want to restore funding for Medicaid that was cut by President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù in July. The false claim that this has anything to do with illegal immigration is tied to the 1.4 million legal immigrants who are losing Medicaid coverage, among the millions of other Americans who are being harmed by the Republican bill. In total, about 17 million people are expected to lose their health insurance, according to [KFF](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/about-17-million-more-people-could-be-uninsured-due-to-the-big-beautiful-bill-and-other-policy-changes/).",1172,2025-10-10 20:42:30,True,none,0,0

The whole point is to flood everything with misinformation that keeps them in power. They're terrified of what happens when Trump‚Äôs not in power anymore.

It would be amazing if private companies, ones that can‚Äôt be bullied by Trump, came out in support of sanity and just laughed off MAGA boycotts. I‚Äôm glad Netflix is still one of the good ones. Their attempt to ‚Äúboycott‚Äù the NFL was hilarious.

It feels dystopian how all these major brands that used to champion equality, science, environmental justice (yes, climate change is real, and banning the phrase is insane), and basic decency¬†have gone silent.

Maybe some things went a little overboard by talking about it all on a soapbox and being annoying, but a complete reversal of everything is so fucking crazy. I get why people want to tone it down, but have you heard what MAGA is actually saying?

When that story broke about Kash firing someone for having a rainbow flag on their desk, I saw hundreds of MAGA comments cheering it on. ‚ÄúGood, fuck them!!‚Äù Vicious, hateful, calling people perverts, saying that era is over forever. Their \*entire\* outrage is that we called them hateful, yet they‚Äôre overflowing with hate. It‚Äôs practically dripping out of their eyes. And it has nothing to do with religion. They are the antithesis of Jesus. It's not political either. They are not Republican! Open Twitter and look at what every single GOP congress member is posting. It is INSANITY. All propaganda.

A few minutes later, there's a knock on the door with tea service. The other three agents are absolutely terrified, fall silent, and go to bed immediately.

The agent gets a good night's sleep but when he wakes up the next morning the other three have been disappeared. He goes down to the front desk and asks, ""What happened to my comrades? And why was I spared?""

>Despite claims that Swift has lost over a million followers, the drop from ""282M"" to ""281M"" is likely due to how Instagram rounds follower numbers for massive accounts. Although some reports suggest a dramatic million-follower drop, precise analytics data from sources like *Social Blade* show her exact count is around 281,989,572, meaning the actual loss was just enough to dip below the 282 million threshold, making the public figure round down.¬†

>Furthermore, *Social Blade* data shows a loss of only about 60,000 followers over the last 14 days, suggesting the initial, significant public drop may have happened earlier, linked to fan backlash over alleged AI use in her album promotion. So, in short, no, Swift didn't lose a million followers, but she did have a significant drop in her follower count.¬†

**TL;DR:** she didn't lose a million followers. Her number of followers just dipped under 282 million to 281,989,572. Rounded down this looks like 282 million > 281 million, despite losing only 60k.",6,2025-10-08 08:21:22,False,none,0,0

nieu8y4,1o195kb,chrisdh79,"From the article: Just so you know: it‚Äôs not normal for your country‚Äôs voice communications networks to be completely hijacked by scammers and marketers, rendering it almost unusable. That‚Äôs literally not something people in most serious countries have to deal with. Yet we‚Äôve largely normalized the fact that Americans are so inundated with unwanted scams and bullshit that they don‚Äôt answer the phone.

Americans have received 4.1 billion robocalls so far this year, or around 135 million each day. A recent survey by Talker Research of 10,500 general population adults indicates that Americans get twice as many scam calls and texts as any other country (and even more than countries that have passed useful consumer protection laws and have functional regulators).

A new [study](https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2025/10/consumer-reports-study-finds-surge-in-texting-and-messaging-scams) from Consumer Reports, Aspen Digital and the Global Cyber Alliance indicates that there‚Äôs been a massive uptick in text messaging-based scams over the last year, especially for younger American consumers aged between 18 ‚Äì 29 years old

‚ÄúCyberattacks and digital scams continue to cause serious harm to American consumers, often with devastating consequences,‚Äù says Yael Grauer, program manager at Consumer Reports. ‚ÄúGovernment and industry must do more to protect consumer privacy and security, but with federal consumer protection agencies facing reduced resources, it is even more critical to empower consumers to adopt strong cybersecurity practices against increasingly sophisticated scams and attacks.‚Äù

Instead, the Trump administration and its extremist courts have effectively lobotomized the U.S. regulatory state, making it difficult or impossible to pass any new consumer protections or enforce existing ones. And the FCC already wasn‚Äôt particularly good at policing robocalls. The country has generally been too corrupt to pass even a baseline internet-era privacy law.

Trump FCC boss Brendan Carr has been taking an absolute hatchet to the FCC‚Äôs consumer protection authority under the guise of improving government efficiency. Carr‚Äôs ‚ÄúDelete, Delete, Delete‚Äù initiative, among other things, has involved plans to eliminate rules that make it easier for U.S. consumers to opt out of unwanted text or phone communications.

Carr‚Äôs also derailing a number of FCC cybersecurity reforms, often with no coherent reason. A sizeable chunk of our robocall is caused by big wireless carriers that turn a blind eye to scams and fraud because they get a cut ‚Äî and Trump is making it all but impossible to hold these companies accountable for anything. And all of this is happening with less transparency and public input than ever.

So however bad you think scam and marketing texts and calls are now, they‚Äôre extremely likely to get significantly worse. This is the end result of an unholy alliance of authoritarianism and corporate power. A fake populist movement stocked with corrupt zealots, dead set on dismantling the country‚Äôs last vestiges of consumer protection.

Like so many systemic U.S. problems, the robocall and phone scam problem simply isn‚Äôt something that gets fixed without first embracing much broader corruption, campaign finance, lobbying, and legal reforms. That is, obviously and indisputably, not something that‚Äôs happening under Trump and his sycophantic regulators and telecom industry-coddling courts.",562,2025-10-08 18:02:11,True,none,0,0

So, I took a look at my native country's biggest news portal to see. Here is a list of bigger news in Norway than Trump today:

* Liv Ullmann is set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Film Academy.
* Camilla Botilsrud Sagen thinks that it is unfortunate that Ulrikke Brandstorp was released from her contract to host the TV program ""Baking Championship"" on NRK.
* Krohn Premium, a developer building holiday homes, has filed for bankruptcy. Several of their projects might not be finished.
* A baby was born in a hotel room at Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg in Bergen. It was an unusual experience for the staff.
* How to best cook potatoes.
* Battlefield 6 received a generally good review.
* Israeli football player Manor Solomon was called a murderer in Spain. The press spokesperson for the Isreaeli football team hopes that the focus will be on sports when Israel plays against Norway on Saturday.
* The political party ""The Loneliness Party"" is disbanding as they only received 712 votes in the last National Elections.
* Publishing house Aschehoug apologises for sending in fake letters to a relationship advice column.
* A new study shows that sleeping problems can lead to erectile dysfunction in younger men.

nimyc0w,1o2c6pa,Dolapevich,"A couple of factors:
- Cities were not as car centric as today. In many EU cities kids do play unsupervised.
- Destruction of the sense of community. Specially in the US and UK since the Reagan/Thatcher years, neoliberalism (the real one) was developed. Instead of the sense of community, it uses the individuality as a driver, which in turn causes a view others as enemies, and the common space as a not mine place.
- Development of mass media fear mongerinc tactics and concentration. Manipulation of masses using fear started to be ubiquitous since the start of the 80s. Media concentrario also caused a disconnect from the media and local issues.
- Rise of technology and indoor: cinema, social clubs, bars were places to socialize, you used to _walk_ to those places, you knew each other, and all that is gone because we have those things indoors. Then again, the other is the enemy until proven otherwise, was not the mindset back then because you knew your neightboors and were part of your community.
- Risk averse mentality: People was expected to know you shouldn't drink the acid of the car battery or shampoo. And if shit happens, we'll, it is life. Whereas  now there is a tragedy every time someone doesn't like the colour of a lolypop.

So yes, it was considered safe, and within the tolerable risks limits.

nin0ldq,1o2c6pa,BrainNSFW,"Definitely true, even in Europe.

The thing is, back then nobody had a portable phone. Communications were limited to a land locked phone in the house. While that may seem like a small detail, it paints a bigger picture: we were used to not being able to reach people/hear from people for a while. In fact, most of the time the telephone only rang if something was ""wrong"" (except during the evening; that's usually when family called in for social calls). 

As a result everybody was way more relaxed as the expectation was simply ""if we don't hear from you, everything is probably alright"". It's hard to imagine now (even for me and I lived during that time) with everybody constantly ""on""/""available"" at the press of a button, but back then there simply was a LOT more patience and less worry. 

I should also note that parents tended to give clear boundaries. Stuff like ""don't go farther than X street"". This kept kids in roughly the same area where everyone else sort of kept an eye out too. It was like an unwritten agreement that every adult kept an eye out for any kids so that their own kids would be looked after by others too.

He worked like seven minutes from his house and she was included in everything he did. This is not a, ‚ÄúI married a doctor and he‚Äôs never home‚Äù type thing. 

The guy made/makes BANK. Like upwards of $400K a year, so financially they were both very comfortable. In the end she wanted a divorce and he was so distraught. I went over to his house for dinner and I was talking with him and their kids asking if they were okay. The two oldest kids flat out said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fine and we don‚Äôt need her‚Äù because they watched her cheat on their dad several times. 

So they divorce. He‚Äôs paying child support, alimony, he has to split the house (that‚Äôs worth over $750K) if they sell or buy her out of her half, AND she demanded that he buy her a house in the same town (expensive area) so that it, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be too hard on the kids.‚Äù

Well he does ALL THE SHIT she demanded. He‚Äôs working overtime for the first time since he was out of Med School. The kids hate her house and the older two pretty much refuse to go over. She still somehow can‚Äôt afford a damn thing despite THOUSANDS of dollars a month in support and a house bought for her.

So they sell the house. She moves back in. He literally had to piece their life back together as best as he could now that most of his stocks are liquidated and his retirement was split and all the other shit that goes into divorce when you have a lot of assets. From what I understand they‚Äôre married now.

>As the Titanic sank in the early hours of 15 April, 1912, he threw the bottle and message into the sea.  
The bottle was washed ashore a year later in Dunkettle, only a few miles from his family home.  
The note, which read ""From Titanic, goodbye all, Burke of Glanmire, Cork"" has remained in the Burke family for nearly a century.  
Now one of Jeremiah's nieces, Mary Woods, has donated it to the Cobh Heritage Centre.  
Ms Woods, who is a councillor, said Jeremiah had been travelling to America with his cousin Nora Hegarty, 18, to meet up with his two sisters who had left for Boston a year previously.  
Both Jeremiah and Nora drowned in the tragedy.  
The councillor told the *Irish Independent* the bottle had been found with one of Jeremiah's bootlaces tied to it.

nif3md0,1o1a3it,YourlocalTitanicguy,"Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ no, probably not :) 

The note is dated April 10th but Titanic wouldn‚Äôt reach or depart Ireland until April 11th, so it would seem odd for Jeremiah to bid farewell from a time and place before he was even on Titanic. 

When Jeremiah supposedly threw it often changes with each retelling. Your source says he threw it during the sinking on the 15th (but why dated the 10th?), while alternate versions say he threw it as he left Ireland on the 11th. Either way- how would anyone know? 

Messages in bottles claiming to be from Titanic popped up not infrequently following the sinking. It became a somewhat popular attempt at a hoax to make the newspapers- which it usually did.

EDIT: Some context on why this would be a thing. We have to remember that the Titanic disaster was a major international tragedy. It wasn't something that took over the news for a couple of days, it was the 9/11 of its day in terms of newsworthiness and arguably social change both practically and symbolically. Like anything - opportunists, hoaxers, and media whores saw an opportunity here. Messages in bottles from survivors were a trend, as were those claiming to speak to the dead. Those who had even a distant connection to Titanic were selling out speaking engagements, and so were both fake survivors and real survivors telling fake stories to large paying crowds. For an event as world-shaking as the Titanic disaster, all of this was guaranteed to make news because literally *anything* would make news and sell papers.

It's more than likely that's what this is, although much stranger coincidences have happened with remnants from Titanic so I'd never say it was an absolute impossibility (more things in heaven and earth, Horatio and all that).

So this was one attempt at fixing the problem. It didn't work for obvious reasons.

*Real estate giant Greystar and 25 other property management companies have agreed to collectively pay more than $141 million to settle a class action lawsuit accusing landlords of driving up housing costs by using rent-setting algorithms offered by the software company RealPage.*

*Greystar, the nation‚Äôs largest landlord, would pay $50 million under the proposed settlement agreement, which was filed Wednesday in a Tennessee federal court. The deal would still require a judge‚Äôs approval.*

*[...] All companies involved in the settlement deny wrongdoing and have agreed to help plaintiffs in the ongoing case against RealPage and more than a dozen other property management firms that have not reached settlements. RealPage and others are also fighting an antitrust lawsuit filed last year by the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general. Greystar reached a settlement in that case in August.*

*The settlement funds from the class action lawsuit would be distributed among millions of tenants included in the settlement class.*

From the linked article: 

**Major IQ differences in identical twins linked to schooling, challenging decades of research**

A new analysis of studies spanning the last century finds that differences in schooling appear to explain a large portion of the IQ gap between identical twins who were raised in separate homes. The research suggests that **when these twins receive similar educations, their IQ scores are nearly as alike as identical twins raised together, but when their schooling is very different, their IQs can be as dissimilar as those of unrelated strangers**.

Then, of course, there are environmental factors. Injuries, drug use etc can lower IQ so you'd expect differences regardless of genetics in people who had different life trajectories. 

I wonder at what age these IQ tests were administered because education and upbringing is known to raise IQ in adopted children relative to the biological parents until they go off on their own, when their IQ tends to return to the level of their biological parents. 

Then there's the problem of cross comparing individual IQ tests when there is going to be differences due to administration, circumstance etc. My understanding is that IQ is better looked at in the aggregate and is not that useful when cross comparing individuals. There's going to be a lot of variation and IQ tests are all basically taking a bunch of samples of ability to get an approximation of someone's intelligence (called g in the research).

Caveats matter. Schooling isn‚Äôt random. The twin who switches tracks might have had early illness, attention issues, different peer groups, or family stress that also push scores. Tests differ, practice effects matter, and range restriction in past twin samples can shrink or inflate heritability depending on how similar the environments are. Identical twins reared apart still land surprisingly close when their schooling is similar, which is kind of the point here.

Takeaway isn‚Äôt genes don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs that environment sets the ceiling you can actually reach. Years in class and quality of instruction move cognition, and late teen education still has juice. Design for access and rigor and the measured gaps shrink.",1,2025-10-12 11:14:37,False,none,0,0

The chain of events starts and ends with his reckless, impaired driving. Without that, the victim would still be alive. Crash safety standards (FMVSS 208, 214, 206) are built around ~35-40 mph tests. No vehicle on the road is expected to guarantee survival or fully functioning doors after an 80 mph impact into a fixed object. FMVSS 206 only requires doors to stay latched under specific loads, not to remain operable in catastrophic wrecks. An 80 mph tree strike generates over 4x the crash energy of a 40 mph impact, way beyond design limits. Doors jamming is expected physics, not proof of a defect. Even a different car with mechanical door latches could have been jammed up and malfunctioned after that type of a collision.
